SNES Memory
-----------

--> SNES Memory Map

--> SNES Memory Control

Work RAM (WRAM)
Work RAM is mapped directly to the CPU bus, and can be additionally accessed
indirectly via I/O ports (mainly for DMA transfer purposes).
--> SNES Memory Work RAM Access

Video Memory (OAM/VRAM/CGRAM)
All video memory can be accessed only during V-Blank, or Forced Blank.
Video memory isn't mapped to the CPU bus, and can be accessed only via I/O
ports (for bigger transfers, this would be usually done via DMA).
--> SNES Memory OAM Access (Sprite Attributes)
--> SNES Memory VRAM Access (Tile and BG Map)
--> SNES Memory CGRAM Access (Palette Memory)
Access during H-Blank doesn't seem to work too well - it is possible to change
palette entries during H-Blank, but seems to work only during a few clock
cycles, not during the full H-blank period.

Sound RAM
Sound RAM is mapped to a separate SPC700 CPU, not to the Main CPU. Accordingly,
the Main CPU (and DMA) cannot directly access this RAM. Instead, data transfers
are done by using CPU-to-CPU software communication protocol. Upon Reset, this
done by a Boot-ROM on the SPC700 side. For details, see:
--> SNES APU Main CPU Communication Port

DMA Transfers
DMA can be used to quickly transfer memory blocks to/from most memory locations
(except Sound RAM isn't accessible via DMA, and WRAM-to-WRAM transfers don't
work).

 (00FFE0h-00FFFFh) CPU Exception Vectors (Reset, Irq, Nmi, etc.)
Additional memory (not mapped to CPU addresses) (accessible only via I/O):
  OAM          256+16 words (512+32 Bytes)
  VRAM         32K-words    (64K-bytes)
  Palette      256-words    (512 bytes)
  Sound RAM                 (64K-bytes)
  Sound ROM                 (64 bytes BIOS Boot ROM)

32K LoROM Banks with 32K System Area (in each bank)
  nn0000h-nn1FFFh  Mirror of 7E0000h-7E1FFFh (1st 8Kbytes of WRAM)
  nn2000h-nn5FFFh  I/O Ports
  nn6000h-nn7FFFh  Expansion
  nn8000h-nnFFFFh  32Kbyte LoROM bank(s)
ROM is broken up into non-continous 32K blocks, I/O ports and WRAM can be
accessed no matter of the CPU's current DB and PB register settings.
Some LoROM games are bigger than 2Mbytes (eg. Super Metroid, Gunple, Wizardry
6, Derby Stallion 3), these have bank 0-3Fh mapped in the 32K LoROM banks as
usually, and bank 40h and up each mapped twice in the 64K hirom banks.
Note: There's also a different "SpecialLoROM" mapping scheme for 3MByte ROMs
(used by Derby Stallion 96 and Sound Novel Tsukuru; aside from the special ROM
mapping, these cartridges have an additional Data Pack Slot).

64K HiROM Banks
  nn0000h-nnFFFFh  64Kbyte HiROM bank(s)
Provides continous ROM addresses, but doesn't include I/O and WRAM regions
"inside" of the ROM-banks.
The upper halfes of the 64K-HiROM banks are usually mirrored to the
corresponding 32K-LoROM banks, that is important for mapping the interrupt and
reset vectors from 40FFE0h-40FFFFh to 00FFE0h-00FFFFh.

Battery RAM
Reportedly at 700000h in some carts, at nn6000h in other carts.
  HiROM 400000h-7DFFFFh (64K Banks) ---> RAM nn6000h-nn7FFFh ;small 8K bank(s)
  LoROM nn8000h-nnFFFFh (32K Banks) ---> RAM 700000h-7xFFFFh ;very HUGE area?

- FastROM's can execute at 3.58Mhz
- SlowROM's can only execute 2.68Mhz
  When accessing bank $00 onwards the 65816 runs at 2.68Mhz. However,
  when accessing bank $80 onwards the 65816 can run at 2.68Mhz or
  3.58Mhz depending on how you set bit 0 of $420D.

Bank Switching
Most SNES games are satisfied with the 24bit address space. Bank switching is
used only in a few games with special chips:
  S-DD1, SA-1, and SPC7110 chips (with mappable 1MByte-banks)
  Satellaview FLASH carts (can enable/disable ROM, PSRAM, FLASH)
  Nintendo Power FLASH carts (can map FLASH and SRAM to desired address)
  Pirate X-in-1 multicart mappers (mappable offset in 256Kbyte units)
  Cheat devices (and X-Band modem) can map their BIOS and can patch ROM bytes
  Copiers can map internal BIOS/DRAM/SRAM and external Cartridge memory
  Hotel Boxes (eg. SFC-Box) can map multiple games/cartridges
And, at the APU side, one can enable/disable the 64-byte boot ROM.

SNES Memory Control
-------------------

420Dh - MEMSEL - Memory-2 Waitstate Control (W)
  7-1   Not used
  0     Access Cycle for Memory-2 Area (0=2.68MHz, 1=3.58MHz) (0 on reset)
Memory-2 consists of address 8000h-FFFFh in bank 80h-BFh, and address
0000h-FFFFh in bank C0h-FFh. 3.58MHz high speed memory requires 120ns or faster
ROMs/EPROMs. 2.68MHz memory requires 200ns or faster ROMs/EPROMs.
  2.684658 MHZ = 21.47727 MHz / 8     ;same access time as WRAM
  3.579545 MHZ = 21.47727 MHz / 6     ;faster access than WRAM
Programs that do use the 3.58MHz setting should also indicate this in the
Cartridge header byte at [FFD5h].Bit4.
--> SNES Cartridge ROM Header

Forced Blank
Allows to access video memory at any time. See INIDISP Bit7, Port 2100h.

SNES Memory Work RAM Access
---------------------------

The SNES includes 128Kbytes of Work RAM, which can be accessed in several ways:
  The whole 128K are at 7E0000h-7FFFFFh.
  The first 8K are also mirrored to xx0000h-xx1FFFh (xx=00h..3Fh and 80h..BFh)
  Moreover (mainly for DMA purposes) it can be accessed via Port 218xh.

2180h - WMDATA - WRAM Data Read/Write (R/W)
  7-0   Work RAM Data
Simply reads or writes the byte at the address in [2181h-2183h], and does then
increment the address by one.
Note: Despite of the fast access time on 2180h reads (faster than
7E0000h-7FFFFFh reads), there is no prefetching involved (reading 2180h always
returns the currently addressed byte, even if one mixes it with writes to 2180h
or to 7E0000h-7FFFFFh).

2181h - WMADDL - WRAM Address (lower 8bit) (W)
2182h - WMADDM - WRAM Address (middle 8bit) (W)
2183h - WMADDH - WRAM Address (upper 1bit) (W)
17bit Address (in Byte-steps) for addressing the 128Kbytes of WRAM via 2180h.

DMA Notes
Not tested in WRAM-to-WRAM DMA is possible... in A-Bus to B-Bus direction,
and/or vice-versa...? Externally, the separate address lines are there, but the
WRAM chip may be unable to process both at once.

Timing Notes
Note that WRAM is accessed at 2.6MHz. Meaning that all variables, stack, and
program code in RAM will be slow. The SNES doesn't include any fast RAM.
However, there are a few tricks to get "3.5MHz RAM":
* Sequential read from WRAM via [2180h] is 3.5MHz fast, and has auto-increment.
* DMA registers at 43x0h-43xBh provide 8x12 bytes of read/write-able "memory".
* External RAM could be mapped to 5000h-5FFFh (but usually it's at slow 6000h).
* External RAM could be mapped to C00000h-FFFFFFh (probably rarely done too).

Other Notes
The B-Bus feature with auto-increment is making it fairly easy to boot the SNES
without any ROM/EPROM by simply writing program bytes to WRAM (and mirroring it
to the Program and Reset vector to ROM area):
--> SNES Xboo Upload (WRAM Boot)
Interestingly, the WRAM-to-ROM Area mirroring seems to be stable even when ROM
Area is set to 3.5MHz Access Time - so it's unclear why Nintendo has restricted
normal WRAM Access to 2.6MHz - maybe some WRAM chips are slower than others, or
maybe they become unstable at certain room temperatures.

SNES Memory OAM Access (Sprite Attributes)
------------------------------------------

2102h/2103h - OAMADDL/OAMADDH - OAM Address and Priority Rotation (W)
  15    OAM Priority Rotation  (0=OBJ #0, 1=OBJ #N) (OBJ with highest priority)
  9-14  Not used
  7-1   OBJ Number #N (for OBJ Priority)   ;\bit7-1 are used for two purposes
  8-0   OAM Address   (for OAM read/write) ;/
This register contains of a 9bit Reload value and a 10bit Address register
(plus the priority flag). Writing to 2102h or 2103h does change the lower 8bit
or upper 1bit of the Reload value, and does additionally copy the (whole) 9bit
Reload value to the 10bit Address register (with address Bit0=0 so next access
will be an even address).
Caution: During rendering, the PPU is destroying the Address register (using it
internally for whatever purposes), after rendering (at begin of Vblank, ie. at
begin of line 225/240, but only if not in Forced Blank mode) it reinitializes
the Address from the Reload value; the same reload occurs also when
deactivating forced blank anytime during the first scanline of vblank (ie.
during line 225/240).

2104h - OAMDATA - OAM Data Write (W)
2138h - RDOAM - OAM Data Read (R)
  1st Access: Lower 8bit (even address)
  2nd Access: Upper 8bit (odd address)
Reads and Writes to EVEN and ODD byte-addresses work as follows:
  Write to EVEN address      -->  set OAM_Lsb = Data    ;memorize value
  Write to ODD address<200h  -->  set WORD[addr-1] = Data*256 + OAM_Lsb
  Write to ANY address>1FFh  -->  set BYTE[addr] = Data
  Read from ANY address      -->  return BYTE[addr]
The address is automatically incremented after every read or write access.
OAM Size is 220h bytes (addresses 220h..3FFh are mirrors of 200h..21Fh).

SNES Memory VRAM Access (Tile and BG Map)
-----------------------------------------

2115h - VMAIN - VRAM Address Increment Mode (W)
  7     Increment VRAM Address after accessing High/Low byte (0=Low, 1=High)
  6-4   Not used
  3-2   Address Translation    (0..3 = 0bit/None, 8bit, 9bit, 10bit)
  1-0   Address Increment Step (0..3 = Increment Word-Address by 1,32,128,128)
The address translation is intended for bitmap graphics (where one would have
filled the BG Map by increasing Tile numbers), technically it does thrice
left-rotate the lower 8, 9, or 10 bits of the Word-address:
  Translation  Bitmap Type              Port [2116h/17h]    VRAM Word-Address
  8bit rotate  4-color; 1 word/plane    aaaaaaaaYYYxxxxx --> aaaaaaaaxxxxxYYY
  9bit rotate  16-color; 2 words/plane  aaaaaaaYYYxxxxxP --> aaaaaaaxxxxxPYYY
  10bit rotate 256-color; 4 words/plane aaaaaaYYYxxxxxPP --> aaaaaaxxxxxPPYYY
Where "aaaaa" would be the normal address MSBs, "YYY" is the Y-index (within a
8x8 tile), "xxxxx" selects one of the 32 tiles per line, "PP" is the bit-plane
index (for BGs with more than one Word per plane). For the intended result
(writing rows of 256 pixels) the Translation should be combined with Increment
Step=1.
For Mode 7 bitmaps one could eventually combine step 32/128 with 8bit/10bit
rotate:
  8bit-rotate/step32   aaaaaaaaXXXxxYYY --> aaaaaaaaxxYYYXXX
  10bit-rotate/step128 aaaaaaXXXxxxxYYY --> aaaaaaxxxxYYYXXX
Though the SNES can't access enought VRAM for fullscreen Mode 7 bitmaps.
Step 32 (without translation) is useful for updating BG Map columns (eg. after
horizontal scrolling).

2116h - VMADDL - VRAM Address (lower 8bit) (W)
2117h - VMADDH - VRAM Address (upper 8bit) (W)
VRAM Address for reading/writing. This is a WORD address (2-byte steps), the
PPU could theoretically address up to 64K-words (128K-bytes), in practice, only
32K-words (64K-bytes) are installed in SNES consoles (VRAM address bit15 is not
connected, so addresses 8000h-FFFFh are mirrors of 0-7FFFh).
After reading/writing VRAM Data, the Word-address can be automatically
incremented by 1,32,128 (depending on the Increment Mode in Port 2115h) (Note:
the Address Translation feature is applied only "temporarily" upon memory
accesses, it doesn't affect the value in Port 2116h-17h).
Writing to 2116h/2117h does prefetch 16bit data from the new address (for later
reading).

2118h - VMDATAL - VRAM Data Write (lower 8bit) (W)
2119h - VMDATAH - VRAM Data Write (upper 8bit) (W)
Writing to 2118h or 2119h does simply modify the LSB or MSB of the currently
addressed VRAM word (with optional Address Translation applied). Depending on
the Increment Mode the address does (or doesn't) get automatically incremented
after the write.

2139h - RDVRAML - VRAM Data Read (lower 8bit) (R)
213Ah - RDVRAMH - VRAM Data Read (upper 8bit) (R)
Reading from these registers returns the LSB or MSB of an internal 16bit
prefetch register. Depending on the Increment Mode the address does (or
doesn't) get automatically incremented after the read.
The prefetch register is filled with data from the currently addressed VRAM
word (with optional Address Translation applied) upon two situations:
  Prefetch occurs AFTER changing the VRAM address (by writing 2116h/17h).
  Prefetch occurs BEFORE incrementing the VRAM address (by reading 2139h/3Ah).
The "Prefetch BEFORE Increment" effect is some kind of a hardware glitch
(Prefetch AFTER Increment would be more useful). Increment/Prefetch in detail:
  1st  Send a byte from OLD prefetch value to the CPU        ;-this always
  2nd  Load NEW value from OLD address into prefetch register;\these only if
  3rd  Increment address so it becomes the NEW address       ;/increment occurs
Increments caused by writes to 2118h/19h don't do any prefetching (the prefetch
register is left totally unchanged by writes).
In practice: After changing the VRAM address (via 2116h/17h), the first
byte/word will be received twice, further values are received from properly
increasing addresses (as a workaround: issue a dummy-read that ignores the 1st
or 2nd value).

=== SNES VRAM DATA ===

BG Map (32x32 entries)
Each BG Map Entry consists of a 16bit value as such:
  Bit 0-9   - Character Number (000h-3FFh)
  Bit 10-12 - Palette Number   (0-7)
  Bit 13    - BG Priority      (0=Lower, 1=Higher)
  Bit 14    - X-Flip           (0=Normal, 1=Mirror horizontally)
  Bit 15    - Y-Flip           (0=Normal, 1=Mirror vertically)
In the "Offset-per-Tile" modes (Mode 2,4,6), BG3 entries are different:
  Bit 15    Apply offset to H/V (0=H, 1=V)  ;-Mode 4 only
  Bit 14    Apply offset to BG2             ;\Mode 2 (... and Mode 6, though
  Bit 13    Apply offset to BG1             ;/       Mode 6 has only BG1 ?)
  Bit 12-10 Not used
  Bit 9-0   Scroll offset to be applied to BG1/BG2
  Lower 3bit of HORIZONTAL offsets are ignored.
In mode7, BG Maps are 128x128, and only the lower 8bit are used as BG map
entries:
  Bit15-8  Not used (contains tile-data; no relation to the BG-Map entry)
  Bit7-0   Character Number (00h-FFh) (without XYflip or other attributes)

VRAM 8x8 Pixel Tile Data (BG and OBJ)
Each 8x8 tile occupies 16, 32, or 64 bytes (for 4, 16, or 256 colors). BG tiles
can be 4/16/256 colors (depending on BG Mode), OBJs are always 16 color.
  Color Bits (Planes)     Upper Row ........... Lower Row
  Plane 0 stored in bytes 00h,02h,04h,06h,08h,0Ah,0Ch,0Eh ;\for 4/16/256 colors
  Plane 1 stored in bytes 01h,03h,05h,07h,09h,0Bh,0Dh,0Fh ;/
  Plane 2 stored in bytes 10h,12h,14h,16h,18h,1Ah,1Ch,1Eh ;\for 16/256 colors
  Plane 3 stored in bytes 11h,13h,15h,17h,19h,1Bh,1Dh,1Fh ;/
  Plane 4 stored in bytes 20h,22h,24h,26h,28h,2Ah,2Ch,2Eh ;\
  Plane 5 stored in bytes 21h,23h,25h,27h,29h,2Bh,2Dh,2Fh ; for 256 colors
  Plane 6 stored in bytes 30h,32h,34h,36h,38h,3Ah,3Ch,3Eh ;
  Plane 7 stored in bytes 31h,33h,35h,37h,39h,3Bh,3Dh,3Fh ;/
  In each byte, bit7 is left-most, bit0 is right-most.
  Plane 0 is the LSB of color number.
The only exception are Mode 7 BG Tiles, which are stored as 8bit pixels
(without spreading the bits across several bit-planes), and, BG VRAM is divided
into BG Map at even byte addresses, and Tiles at odd addresses, an 8x8 tiles
thus uses the following bytes (64 odd bytes within a 128 byte region):
  Vertical Rows           Left-most .......... Right-Most
  Upper Row      in bytes 01h,03h,05h,07h,09h,0Bh,0Dh,0Fh ;\
  2nd Row        in bytes 11h,13h,15h,17h,19h,1Bh,1Dh,1Fh ;
  3rd Row        in bytes 21h,23h,25h,27h,29h,2Bh,2Dh,2Fh ;
  4th Row        in bytes 31h,33h,35h,37h,39h,3Bh,3Dh,3Fh ; 256-color
  5th Row        in bytes 41h,43h,45h,47h,49h,4Bh,4Dh,4Fh ; Mode 7
  6th Row        in bytes 51h,53h,55h,57h,59h,5Bh,5Dh,5Fh ;
  7th Row        in bytes 61h,63h,65h,67h,69h,6Bh,6Dh,6Fh ;
  Bottom Row     in bytes 71h,73h,75h,77h,79h,7Bh,7Dh,7Fh ;/

16x16 (and bigger) Tiles
BG tiles can be up to 16x16 pixels in size, and OBJs up to 64x64. In both
cases, the big tiles are combined of multiple 8x8 pixel tiles, whereas VRAM is
organized as "two-dimensional" array of 16x64 BG Tiles and 16x32 OBJ Tiles:
The BG Map or OAM entry contain the Tile number (N) for the upper-left 8x8
tile. The tile(s) right of that tile are N+1 (and N+2, N+3, etc). The tile(s)
under that tile are N+10h (and N+20h, N+30h, etc).
  32x32 pixel OBJ Tile 000h
  Tile000h,  Tile001h,  Tile002h,  Tile003h
  Tile010h,  Tile011h,  Tile012h,  Tile013h
  Tile020h,  Tile021h,  Tile022h,  Tile023h
  Tile030h,  Tile031h,  Tile032h,  Tile033h
The hex-tile numbers could be thus thought of as "Yyxh", with "x" being the
4bit x-index, and "Yy" being the y-index in the array. For OBJ tiles, the are
no carry-outs from "x+1" to "y", nor from "y+1" to "Y". Whilst BG tiles are
processing carry-outs. For example:
  16x16 BG Tile 1FFh     16x16 OBJ Tile 1FFh
  Tile1ffh Tile200h      Tile1ffh Tile1f0h
  Tile20fh Tile210h      Tile10fh Tile100h

SNES Memory CGRAM Access (Palette Memory)
-----------------------------------------

2121h - CGADD - Palette CGRAM Address (Color Generator Memory) (W)
Color index (0..255). This is a WORD-address (2-byte steps), allowing to access
256 words (512 bytes). Writing to this register resets the 1st/2nd access
flipflop (for 2122h/213Bh) to 1st access.

2122h - CGDATA - Palette CGRAM Data Write (W)
213Bh - RDCGRAM - Palette CGRAM Data Read (R)
  1st Access: Lower 8 bits (even address)
  2nd Access: Upper 7 bits (odd address) (upper 1bit = PPU2 open bus)
Reads and Writes to EVEN and ODD byte-addresses work as follows:
  Write to EVEN address  -->  set Cgram_Lsb = Data    ;memorize value
  Write to ODD address   -->  set WORD[addr-1] = Data*256 + Cgram_Lsb
  Read from ANY address  -->  return BYTE[addr]
The address is automatically incremented after every read or write access.

256-Color Palette Entries
  15    Not used (should be zero) (read: PPU2 Open Bus)
  14-10 Blue
  9-5   Green
  4-0   Red

Palette Indices
  00h      Main Backdrop color (used when all BG/OBJ pixels are transparent)
  01h-FFh  256-color BG palette (when not using direct-color mode)
  01h-7Fh  128-color BG palette (BG2 in Mode 7)
  01h-7Fh  Eight 16-color BG palettes
  01h-1Fh  Eight 4-color BG palettes (except BG2-4 in Mode 0)
  21h-3Fh  Eight 4-color BG palettes (BG2 in Mode 0 only)
  41h-5Fh  Eight 4-color BG palettes (BG3 in Mode 0 only)
  61h-7Fh  Eight 4-color BG palettes (BG4 in Mode 0 only)
  81h-FFh  Eight 16-color OBJ palettes (half of them with color-math disabled)
  N/A      Sub Backdrop color (not in CGRAM, set via COLDATA, Port 2132h)

Direct Color Mode
256-color BGs (ie. BG1 in Mode 3,4,7) can be optionally set to direct-color
mode (via 2130h.Bit0; this bit hides in one of the Color-Math registers,
although it isn't related to Color-Math). The 8bit Color number is interpreted
as "BBGGGRRR", the 3bit Palette number (from the BG Map) contains LSBs as
"bgr", together they are forming a 15bit color "BBb00:RRRr0:GGGg0". Whereas the
"bgr" can defined only per tile (not per pixel), and it can be defined only in
BG Modes 3-4 (Mode 7 has no palette attributes in BG Map).
  Color Bit7-0 all zero --> Transparent    ;-Color "Black" is Transparent!
  Color Bit7-6   Blue Bit4-3               ;\
  Palette Bit 2  Blue Bit2                 ; 5bit Blue
  N/A            Blue Bit1-0 (always zero) ;/
  Color Bit5-3   Green Bit4-2              ;\
  Palette Bit 1  Green Bit1                ; 5bit Green
  N/A            Green Bit0 (always zero)  ;/
  Color Bit2-0   Red Bit4-2                ;\
  Palette Bit 0  Red Bit1                  ; 5bit Red
  N/A            Red Bit0 (always zero)    ;/
To define Black, either set the Backdrop to Black (works only if there are no
layers behind BG1), or use a dark non-transparent "near-black" color (eg.
01h=Dark Red, 09h=Dark Brown).

Screen Border Color
The Screen Border is always Black (no matter of CGRAM settings and Sub Screen
Backdrop Color). NTSC 256x224 images are (more or less) fullscreen, so there
should be no visible screen border (however, a 2-3 pixel border may appear at
the screen edges if the screen isn't properly centered). Both PAL 256x224 and
PAL 256x239 images images will have black upper and lower screen borders (a
fullscreen PAL picture would be around 256x264, which isn't supported by the
SNES).

Forced Blank Color
In Forced Blank, the whole screen is Black (no matter of CGRAM settings, Sub
Screen Backdrop Color, and Master Brightness settings). Vsync/Hsync are kept
generated (sending a black picture with valid Sync signals to the TV set).

SNES DMA Transfers
------------------

The SNES includes eight DMA channels, which can be used for H-DMA or GP-DMA.
H-DMA transfers are automatically invoked on H-Blank, each H-DMA is limited to
a single unit (max 4 bytes) per scanline.
GP-DMA transfers (General Purpose DMA) are can manually invoked by software,
allowing to transfer larger amounts of data (max 10000h bytes).

       XXX? transfer order is  channel 0 first, channel 7 last
            HDMA has higher prio than DMA
            HDMA is running even during Forced Blank.

420Bh - MDMAEN - Select General Purpose DMA Channel(s) and Start Transfer (W)
  7-0   General Purpose DMA Channel 7-0 Enable (0=Disable, 1=Enable)
When writing a non-zero value to this register, general purpose DMA will be
started immediately (after a few clk cycles). The CPU is paused during the
transfer. The transfer can be interrupted by H-DMA transfers. If more than 1
bit is set in MDMAEN, then the separate transfers will be executed in WHICH?
priority order. The MDMAEN bits are cleared automatically at transfer
completion.
Do not use channels for GP-DMA which are activated as H-DMA in HDMAEN.

420Ch - HDMAEN - Select H-Blank DMA (H-DMA) Channel(s) (W)

A HDMA transfers ONE unit per scanline (=max 4 bytes). General Purpose DMA has
a 16bit length counter, allowing to transfer up to 10000h bytes (ie. not 10000h
units).

43x1h - BBADx - DMA/HDMA I/O-Bus Address (PPU-Bus aka B-Bus) (R/W)
For both DMA and HDMA:
  7-0   B-Bus Address (selects an I/O Port which is mapped to 2100h-21FFh)

43x2h - A1TxL - HDMA Table Start Address (low) / DMA Current Addr (low) (R/W)
43x3h - A1TxH - HDMA Table Start Address (hi)  / DMA Current Addr (hi) (R/W)
43x4h - A1Bx - HDMA Table Start Address (bank) / DMA Current Addr (bank) (R/W)
For normal DMA:
  23-16  CPU-Bus Data Address Bank (constant, not incremented/decremented)
  15-0   CPU-Bus Data Address (incremented/decremented/fixed, as selected)
For HDMA:
  23-16  CPU-Bus Table Address Bank (constant, bank number for 43x8h/43x9h)
  15-0   CPU-Bus Table Address      (constant, reload value for 43x8h/43x9h)

43x5h - DASxL - Indirect HDMA Address (low) / DMA Byte-Counter (low) (R/W)
43x6h - DASxH - Indirect HDMA Address (hi)  / DMA Byte-Counter (hi)  (R/W)
43x7h - DASBx - Indirect HDMA Address (bank) (R/W)
For normal DMA:
  23-16  Not used
  15-0   Number of bytes to be transferred (1..FFFFh=1..FFFFh, or 0=10000h)
  (This is really a byte-counter; with a 4-byte "Transfer Unit", len=5 would
  transfer one whole Unit, plus the first byte of the second Unit.)
  (The 16bit value is decremented during transfer, and contains 0000h on end.)
For HDMA in direct mode:
  23-0   Not used     (in this mode, the Data is read directly from the Table)
For HDMA in indirect mode:
  23-16  Current CPU-Bus Data Address Bank   (this must be set by software)
  16-0   Current CPU-Bus Data Address (automatically loaded from the Table)

43x8h - A2AxL - HDMA Table Current Address (low) (R/W)
43x9h - A2AxH - HDMA Table Current Address (high) (R/W)
For normal DMA:
  15-0  Not used
For HDMA:
  -     Current Table Address Bank (taken from 43x4h)
  15-0  Current Table Address (reloaded from 43x2h/43x3h) (incrementing)

43xAh - NTRLx - HDMA Line-Counter (from current Table entry) (R/W)
For normal DMA:
  7-0   Not used
For HDMA:
  7     Repeat                            ;\(loaded from Table, and then
  6-0   Number of lines to be transferred ;/decremented per scanline)

43xBh - UNUSEDx - Unused Byte (R/W)
  7-0   Not used (read/write-able)
Can be used as a fast RAM location (but NOT as a fixed DMA source address for
memfill). Storing any value in this register seems to have no effect on the
transfer (and the value is left intact, not modified by DMA nor direct nor
indirect HDMAs).

43xCh..43xEh - Unused region (open bus)
Unused. Reading returns garbage (open bus), writing seems to have no effect,
even when trying to "disturb" HDMAs.

43xFh - MIRRx - Read/Write-able mirror of 43xBh (R/W)
Mirror of 43xBh.

HDMA Table Formats (in Direct and Indirect Mode)
In Direct Mode, the table consists of entries in following format:
  1 byte   Repeat-flag & line count
  N bytes  Data (where N=unit size, if repeat=1: multiplied by line count)
In Indirect Mode, the table consists of entries in following format:
  1 byte   Repeat-flag & line count
  2 bytes  16bit pointer to N bytes of Data (where N = as for Direct HDMA)
In either mode: The "repeat-flag & line count" bytes can be:
  00h       Terminate this HDMA channel (until it restarts in next frame)
  01h..80h  Transfer 1 unit in 1 line, then pause for next "X-01h" lines
  81h..FFh  Transfer X-80h units in X-80h lines ("repeat mode")
The "count" and "pointer" values are always READ from the table. The "data"
values are READ or WRITTEN depending on the transfer direction. The transfer
step is always INCREMENTING for HDMA (for both the table itself, as well as for
any indirectly addressed data blocks).

External DMA
The SNES Cartridge Slot doesn't have any special DRQ/DACK pins for DMA
handshaking purposes; DMA from cartridge memory is just implemented as normal
memory access (so the cartridge must respond to DMAs within normal memory
access time; which is fixed 8 master cycles for DMA).
Unknown if the data decompression chips (S-DD1 and SPC7110) are implemented the
same way, or if they do use any "hidden" DMA handshaking mechanisms (they might
be too slow to supply bytes within 8 master cycles, and at least one of them
seems to decode DMA channel numbers; possibly by sensing writes to 420Bh?).

2100h - INIDISP - Display Control 1 (W)
  7     Forced Blanking (0=Normal, 1=Screen Black)
  6-4   Not used
  3-0   Master Brightness (0=Screen Black, or N=1..15: Brightness*(N+1)/16)
In Forced Blank, VRAM, OAM and CGRAM can be freely accessed (otherwise it's
accessible only during Vblank). Even when in forced blank, the TV Set keeps
receiving Vsync/Hsync signals (thus producing a stable black picture). And, the
CPU keeps receiving Hblank/Vblank signals (so any enabled video NMIs, IRQs,
HDMAs are kept generated).
  Forced blank doesn't apply immediately... so one must wait whatever
  (maybe a scanline) before VRAM can be freely accessed... or is it only
  vice-versa: disabling forced blank doesn't apply immediately/shows garbage
  pixels?

Mode 5/6 don't support screen addition/subtraction.
CG Direct Select is support on BG1 of Mode 3/4, and on BG1/BG2? of Mode 7.

2106h - MOSAIC - Mosaic Size and Mosaic Enable (W)
Allows to divide the BG layer into NxN pixel blocks, in each block, the
hardware picks the upper-left pixel of each block, and fills the whole block by
the color - thus effectively reducing the screen resolution.
  7-4  Mosaic Size        (0=Smallest/1x1, 0Fh=Largest/16x16)
  3    BG4 Mosaic Enable  (0=Off, 1=On)
  2    BG3 Mosaic Enable  (0=Off, 1=On)
  1    BG2 Mosaic Enable  (0=Off, 1=On)
  0    BG1 Mosaic Enable  (0=Off, 1=On)
Horizontally, the first block is always located on the left edge of the TV
screen. Vertically, the first block is located on the top of the TV screen.
When changing the mosaic size mid-frame, the hardware does first finish current
block (using the old vertical size) before applying the new vertical size.
Technically, vertical mosaic is implemented as so: subtract the veritical index
(within the current block) from the vertical scroll register (BGnVOFS).

Note: Port 210Dh/210Eh are also used as M7HOFS/M7VOFS, these registers have a
similar purpose, but internally they are separate registers: Writing to 210Dh
does BOTH update M7HOFS (via M7_old mechanism), and also updates BG1HOFS (via
BG_old mechanism). In the same fashion, 210Eh updates both M7VOFS and BG1VOFS.

Formula
Formula for Rotation/Enlargement/Reduction in Matrix Form:
  ( VRAM.X )  =  ( M7A M7B )  *  ( SCREEN.X+M7HOFS-M7X )  +  ( M7X )
  ( VRAM.Y )     ( M7C M7D )     ( SCREEN.Y+M7VOFS-M7Y )     ( M7Y )
Parameters:
  M7A=+COS(angle)*ScaleX, M7B=+SIN(angle)*ScaleX
  M7C=-SIN(angle)*ScaleY, M7D=+COS(angle)*ScaleY
  M7X,M7Y       = Center Coordinate
  M7HOFS,M7VOFS = Scroll Offset
  SCREEN.X = Display (Target) X-Coordinate: (0..255) XOR (xflip*FFh)
  SCREEN.Y = Display (Target) Y-Coordinate: (1..224 or 1..239) XOR (yflip*FFh)
  VRAM.X,Y = BG Map (Source) Coordinates (in 1/256 pixel units)
To calculate VRAM coordinates for any SCREEN coordinates:
  IF xflip THEN SCREEN.X=((0..255) XOR FFh), ELSE SCREEN.X=(0..255)
  IF yflip THEN SCREEN.Y=((1..224/239) XOR FFh), ELSE SCREEN.Y=(1..224/239)
  ORG.X = (M7HOFS-M7X) AND NOT 1C00h, IF ORG.X<0 THEN ORG.X=ORG.X OR 1C00h
  ORG.Y = (M7VOFS-M7Y) AND NOT 1C00h, IF ORG.Y<0 THEN ORG.Y=ORG.Y OR 1C00h
  VRAM.X = ((M7A*ORG.X) AND NOT 3Fh) + ((M7B*ORG.Y) AND NOT 3Fh) + M7X*100h
  VRAM.Y = ((M7C*ORG.X) AND NOT 3Fh) + ((M7D*ORG.Y) AND NOT 3Fh) + M7Y*100h
  VRAM.X = VRAM.X + ((M7B*SCREEN.Y) AND NOT 3Fh) + (M7A*SCREEN.X)
  VRAM.Y = VRAM.Y + ((M7D*SCREEN.Y) AND NOT 3Fh) + (M7C*SCREEN.X)
After calculating the left-most pixel of a scanline, the following pixels on
that scanline can be also calculated by increasing VRAM coordinates as so:
  IF xflip THEN VRAM.X=VRAM.X-M7A, ELSE VRAM.X=VRAM.X+M7A
  IF xflip THEN VRAM.Y=VRAM.Y-M7C, ELSE VRAM.Y=VRAM.Y+M7C
  (The result is same as on hardware, although the real hardware doesn't seem
  to use that method, instead it seems to contain an excessively fast multiply
  unit that recalculates (M7A*SCREEN.X) and (M7C*SCREEN.X) on every pixel.)
The VRAM coordinates are then: bit0-7=Fraction, bit8-10=pixel index (within a
tile), bit11-17=map index (within BG map), bit18-and-up=nonzero when exceeding
BG map size (do "screen over" handling).

M7A/M7B Port Notes
Port 211Bh/211Ch can be also used for general purpose math multiply:
--> SNES Maths Multiply/Divide
When in BG Mode 7, general purpose multiply works only during V-Blank and
Forced-Blank. During drawing period at SCREEN.Y=0..224/239 (including
SCREEN.Y=0, and during all 340 dots including H-Blank), MPYL/M/H receives two
multiplication results per pixel (one per half-pixel):
  MPY = M7A * ORG.X / 8                                ;at SCREEN.X=-3.0
  MPY = M7D * ORG.Y / 8                                ;at SCREEN.X=-2.5
  MPY = M7B * ORG.Y / 8                                ;at SCREEN.X=-2.0
  MPY = M7C * ORG.X / 8                                ;at SCREEN.X=-1.5
  MPY = M7B * ((SCREEN.Y-MOSAIC.Y) XOR (yflip*FFh))/ 8 ;at SCREEN.X=-1.0
  MPY = M7D * ((SCREEN.Y-MOSAIC.Y) XOR (yflip*FFh))/ 8 ;at SCREEN.X=-0.5
  MPY = M7A * ((SCREEN.X AND FFh) XOR (xflip*FFh)) / 8 ;at SCREEN.X=0.0..336.0
  MPY = M7C * ((SCREEN.X AND FFh) XOR (xflip*FFh)) / 8 ;at SCREEN.X=0.5..336.5
  MPY = M7A * (M7B/100h)                   ;during in V-Blank and Forced-Blank
Note: The "/8" suggests that the hardware strips the lower 3bit, however,
before summing up the multiply results, it DOES strip the lower 6bit (hence the
AND NOT 3Fh in the formula).

M7HOVS/M7VOFS Port Notes
Port 210Dh/210Eh are also used as BG1HOFS/BG1VOFS, these registers have a
similar purpose, but internally they are separate registers: Writing to 210Dh
does BOTH update M7HOFS (via M7_old mechanism), and also updates BG1HOFS (via
BG_old mechanism). In the same fashion, 210Eh updates both M7VOFS and BG1VOFS.

M7xx - Write-twice mechanism for Mode 7
Writing a <new> byte to one of the write-twice M7'registers does:
  M7_reg = new * 100h + M7_old
  M7_old = new
M7_old is an internal 8bit register, shared by 210Dh-210Eh and 211Bh-2120h.

SNES PPU Window
---------------

The window feature allows to disable BG/OBJ layers in selected regions, and
also to alter Color-Math effects in selected regions.

2126h - WH0 - Window 1 Left Position (X1) (W)
2127h - WH1 - Window 1 Right Position (X2) (W)
2128h - WH2 - Window 2 Left Position (X1) (W)
2129h - WH3 - Window 2 Right Position (X2) (W)
Specifies the horizontal boundaries of the windows. Note that there are no
vertical boundaries (these could be implemented by manipulating the window
registers via IRQ and/or HDMA).
  7-0   Window Position (00h..0FFh; 0=leftmost, 255=rightmost)
The "inside-window" region extends from X1 to X2 (that, including the X1 and X2
coordinates), so the window width is X2-X1+1. If the width is zero (or
negative), then the "inside-window" becomes empty, and the whole screen will be
treated "outside-window".

2123h - W12SEL - Window BG1/BG2 Mask Settings (W)
2124h - W34SEL - Window BG3/BG4 Mask Settings (W)

  3-2  BG1   BG3   OBJ   Window-2 Area (0..1=Disable, 1=Inside, 2=Outside)
  1-0  BG1   BG3   OBJ   Window-1 Area (0..1=Disable, 1=Inside, 2=Outside)
Allows to select if the window area is inside or outside the X1,X2 coordinates,
or to disable the area.

212Ah/212Bh - WBGLOG/WOBJLOG - Window 1/2 Mask Logic (W)
  Bit  212Ah 212Bh
  7-6  BG4   -     Window 1/2 Mask Logic (0=OR, 1=AND, 2=XOR, 3=XNOR)
  5-4  BG3   -     Window 1/2 Mask Logic (0=OR, 1=AND, 2=XOR, 3=XNOR)
  3-2  BG2   MATH  Window 1/2 Mask Logic (0=OR, 1=AND, 2=XOR, 3=XNOR)
  1-0  BG1   OBJ   Window 1/2 Mask Logic (0=OR, 1=AND, 2=XOR, 3=XNOR)
Allows to merge the Window 1 and 2 areas into a single "final" window area
(which is then used by TMW, TSW, and CGWSEL). The OR/AND/XOR/XNOR logic is
applied ONLY if BOTH window 1 and 2 are enabled (in WxxSEL registers). If only
one window is enabled, then that window is used as is as "final" area. If both
are disabled, then the "final" area will be empty. Note: "XNOR" means "1 XOR
area1 XOR area2" (ie. the inverse of the normal XOR result).

212Eh - TMW - Window Area Main Screen Disable (W)
212Fh - TSW - Window Area Sub Screen Disable (W)
  7-5  Not used
  4    OBJ (0=Enable, 1=Disable)  ;\"Disable" forcefully disables the layer

  0    BG1 (0=Enable, 1=Disable)  ;/
  -    Backdrop (Always enabled)
Allows to disable video layers within the window region.

SNES PPU Color-Math
-------------------

Main Screen / Sub Screen Enable
Main Screen and Sub Screen BG/OBJ can be enabled via Port 212Ch/212Dh (see PPU
Control chapter). When using the Window feature, they can be additionally
disabled in selected areas via Port 212Eh/212Fh.
The Backdrops are always enabled as both Main and Sub screen. Of which, the Sub
screen backdrop can be effectively disabled (made fully transparent) by setting
its color to Black.
The PPU computes the Front-most Non-transparent Main-Screen Pixel, and
Front-most Non-transparent Sub-Screen Pixel (or if there's none, it uses the
Mainscreen or Subscreen Backdrop color).

2130h - CGWSEL - Color Math Control Register A (W)
  7-6  Force Main Screen Black (3=Always, 2=MathWindow, 1=NotMathWin, 0=Never)
  5-4  Color Math Enable       (0=Always, 1=MathWindow, 2=NotMathWin, 3=Never)
  3-2  Not used
  1    Sub Screen BG/OBJ Enable    (0=No/Backdrop only, 1=Yes/Backdrop+BG+OBJ)
  0    Direct Color (for 256-color BGs)  (0=Use Palette, 1=Direct Color)

2131h - CGADSUB - Color Math Control Register B (W)
  7    Color Math Add/Subtract        (0=Add; Main+Sub, 1=Subtract; Main-Sub)
  6    Color Math "Div2" Half Result  (0=No divide, 1=Divide result by 2)
  5    Color Math when Main Screen = Backdrop        (0=Off, 1=On) ;\
  4    Color Math when Main Screen = OBJ/Palette4..7 (0=Off, 1=On) ; OFF: Show
  -    Color Math when Main Screen = OBJ/Palette0..3 (Always=Off)  ; Raw Main,
  3    Color Math when Main Screen = BG4             (0=Off, 1=On) ;   or
  2    Color Math when Main Screen = BG3             (0=Off, 1=On) ; ON: Show
  1    Color Math when Main Screen = BG2             (0=Off, 1=On) ; Main+/-Sub
  0    Color Math when Main Screen = BG1             (0=Off, 1=On) ;/
Half-Color (Bit6): Ignored if "Force Main Screen Black" is used, also ignored
on transparent subscreen pixels (those use the fixed color as sub-screen
backdrop without division) (whilst 2130.1 uses the fixed color as
non-transparent one, which allows division).
Bit0-5: Seem to affect MAIN SCREEN layers:
  Disable = Display RAW Main Screen as such (without math)
  Enable  = Apply math on Mainscreen
  (Ie. 212Ch enables the main screen, 2131h selects if math is applied on it)

2132h - COLDATA - Color Math Sub Screen Backdrop Color (W)
This 8bit port allows to manipulate some (or all) bits of a 15bit RGB value.
Examples: Black: write E0h (R,G,B=0), Cyan: write 20h (R=0) and DFh (G,B=1Fh).
  7    Apply Blue  (0=No change, 1=Apply Intensity as Blue)
  6    Apply Green (0=No change, 1=Apply Intensity as Green)
  5    Apply Red   (0=No change, 1=Apply Intensity as Red)
  4-0  Intensity   (0..31)
The Sub Screen Backdrop Color is used when all sub screen layers are disabled
or transparent, in this case the "Div2" Half Color Math isn't applied (ie.
2131h.Bit6 is ignored); there is one exception: If "Sub Screen BG/OBJ Enable"
is off (2130h.Bit1=0), then the "Div2" isn't forcefully ignored.
For a FULLY TRANSPARENT backdrop: Set this register to Black (adding or
subtracting black has no effect, and, with "Div2" disabled/ignored, the raw
Main screen is displayed as is).

Color Math
Color Math can be disabled setting 2130h.Bit6-7, or by clearing 2131h.Bit0-5.
When it is disabled, only the Main Screen is displayed, and the Sub Screen has
no effect on the display.

Color math occurs only if the front-most Main Screen pixel has math enabled
(via 2131h.Bit0-5.), and only if the front-most Sub Screen pixel has same or
higher (XXX or is it same or lower -- or is it ANY priority?) priority than the
Main Screen pixel.

Same priority means that, for example, BG1 can be mathed with itself: BG1+BG1
gives double-brightness (or same brightness when Div2 is enabled), and, BG1-BG1
gives Black.

Addition/Subtraction is done per R,G,B color fragment, the results can be
(optionally) divided by 2, and are then saturated to Max=31 and Min=0).

Force Main Screen Black
This feature forces the whole Main Screen (including Backdrop) to become black,
so, normally, the whole screen becomes black. However, color addition can be
still applied (but, with the "Div2" not being applied). Whereas, although it
looks all black, the Main Screen is still divided into black BG1 pixels, black
BG2 pixels, and so on. Of which, one can disable Color Math for some of the
pixels. Color Subtraction has no effect (since the pixels can't get blacker
than black).

Hires and Pseudo 3-Layer Math
In Hires modes (BG Mode 5,6 and Pseudo Hires via SETINI), the main/sub screen
pixels are rendered as half-pixels of the high-resolution image. The TV picture
is so blurry, that the result will look quite similar to Color Addition with
Div2 - some games (Jurassic Park and Kirby's Dream Land 3) are actually using
it for that purpose; the advantage is that one can additionally apply COLDATA
addition to (both) main/sub-screen layers, ie. the result looks like
"(main+sub)/2+coldata".

SNES PPU Timers and Status
--------------------------

2137h - SLHV - Latch H/V-Counter by Software (R)
  7-0  Not used (CPU Open Bus; usually last opcode, 21h for "MOV A,[2137h]")
Reading from this register latches the current H/V counter values into
OPHCT/OPVCT, Ports 213Ch and 213Dh.
Reading here works "as if" dragging IO7 low (but it does NOT actually output a
LOW level to IO7 on joypad 2).

213Ch - OPHCT - Horizontal Counter Latch (R)
213Dh - OPVCT - Vertical Counter Latch (R)
There are three situations that do load H/V counter values into the latches:
  Doing a dummy-read from SLHV (Port 2137h) by software
  Switching WRIO (Port 4201h) Bit7 from 1-to-0 by software
  Lightgun High-to-Low transition (Pin6 of 2nd Controller connector)
All three methods are working only if WRIO.Bit7 is (or was) set. If so, data is
latched, and (in all three cases) the latch flag in 213Fh.Bit6 is set.
  1st read  Lower 8bit
  2nd read  Upper 1bit (other 7bit PPU2 open bus; last value read from PPU2)
There are two separate 1st/2nd-read flipflops (one for OPHCT, one for OPVCT),
both flipflops can be reset by reading from Port 213Fh (STAT78), the flipflops
aren't automatically reset when latching occurs.

        H Counter values range from 0 to 339, with 22-277 being visible on the
        screen. V Counter values range from 0 to 261 in NTSC mode (262 is
        possible every other frame when interlace is active) and 0 to 311 in
        PAL mode (312 in interlace?), with 1-224 (or 1-239(?) if overscan is
        enabled) visible on the screen.

213Eh - STAT77 - PPU1 Status and Version Number (R)
  7    OBJ Time overflow  (0=Okay, 1=More than 8x34 OBJ pixels per scanline)
  6    OBJ Range overflow (0=Okay, 1=More than 32 OBJs per scanline)
  5    Master/Slave Mode (PPU1.Pin25) (0=Normal=Master)
  4    Not used (PPU1 open bus) (same as last value read from PPU1)
  3-0  PPU1 5C77 Version Number (only version 1 exists as far as I know)
The overflow flags are cleared at end of V-Blank, but NOT during forced blank!
The overflow flags are set (regardless of OBJ enable/disable in 212Ch), at
following times: Bit6 when V=OBJ.YLOC/H=OAM.INDEX*2, bit7 when
V=OBJ.YLOC+1/H=0.

213Fh - STAT78 - PPU2 Status and Version Number (R)
  7    Current Interlace-Frame (0=1st, 1=2nd Frame)
  6    H/V-Counter/Lightgun/Joypad2.Pin6 Latch Flag (0=No, 1=New Data Latched)
  5    Not used (PPU2 open bus) (same as last value read from PPU2)
  4    Frame Rate (PPU2.Pin30)  (0=NTSC/60Hz, 1=PAL/50Hz)
  3-0  PPU2 5C78 Version Number (version 1..3 exist as far as I know)
Reading from this register also resets the latch flag (bit6), and resets the
two OPHCT/OPVCT 1st/2nd-read flipflops.

Lightgun Coordinates
The screen coordinates (X,Y; with 0,0 = upper left) are related as so:
  Super Scope  X=OPHCNT-40, Y=OPVCT-1   (games support software calibration)
  Justifier 1  X=OPHCNT-??, Y=OPVCT-?   (games support software calibration)
  Justifier 2  X=OPHCNT-??, Y=OPVCT-?   (games support software calibration)
  M.A.C.S.     X=OPHCNT-76, Y=OPVCT-41  (hardcoded, mechanical calibration)
Drawing starts at H=22, V=1 (which explains parts of the offsets). Horizontal
offsets greater than 22 are explained by signal switching/transmission delays.
The huge vertical offset of the M.A.C.S. gun is caused by the lightpen being
mounted above of the barrel (rather than inside of it) (and apparently not
parallel to it, since V>Y instead of V<Y), this implies that the barrel cannot
be aimed at screen coordinates Y=151..191 (since the lightpen would be
offscreen).
Most games support software calibration. The only exception is M.A.C.S. which
requires mechanical hardware calibration (assisted by a test screen, activated
by pressing Button A, and then Select Button on joypad 1).

SNES PPU Interrupts
-------------------

4200h - NMITIMEN - Interrupt Enable and Joypad Request (W)
  7     VBlank NMI Enable  (0=Disable, 1=Enable) (Initially disabled on reset)
  6     Not used
  5-4   H/V IRQ (0=Disable, 1=At H=H + V=Any, 2=At V=V + H=0, 3=At H=H + V=V)
  3-1   Not used
  0     Joypad Enable    (0=Disable, 1=Enable Automatic Reading of Joypad)
Disabling IRQs (via bit4-5) does additionally acknowledge IRQs. There's no such
effect when disabling NMIs (via bit7).

4207h/4208h - HTIMEL/HTIMEH - H-Count Timer Setting (W)
  15-9  Not used
  8-0   H-Count Timer Value (0..339) (+/-1 in long/short lines) (0=leftmost)
The H/V-IRQ flag in Bit7 of TIMEUP, Port 4211h gets set when the H-Counter gets
equal to the H-Count register value.

4209h/420Ah - VTIMEL/VTIMEH - V-Count Timer Setting (W)
  15-9  Not used
  8-0   V-Count Timer Value (0..261/311, NTSC/PAL) (+1 in interlace) (0=top)
The H/V-IRQ flag in Bit7 of TIMEUP, Port 4211h gets set when the V-Counter gets
equal to the V-Count register value.

4210h - RDNMI - V-Blank NMI Flag and CPU Version Number (R) (Read/Ack)
  7     Vblank NMI Flag  (0=None, 1=Interrupt Request) (set on Begin of Vblank)
  6-4   Not used
  3-0   CPU 5A22 Version Number (version 2 exists)
The NMI flag gets set at begin of Vblank (this happens even if NMIs are
disabled). The flag gets reset automatically at end of Vblank, and gets also
reset after reading from this register.
The SNES has only one NMI source (vblank), and the NMI flag is automatically
reset (on vblank end), so there's normally no need to read/acknowledge the
flag, except one special case: If one does disable and re-enable NMIs, then an
old NMI may be executed again; acknowledging avoids that effect.
The CPU includes another internal NMI flag, which gets set when "[4200h].7 AND
[4210h].7" changes from 0-to-1, and gets cleared when the NMI gets executed
(which should happen around after the next opcode) (if a DMA transfer is in
progress, then it is somewhere after the DMA, in that case the NMI can get
executed outside of the Vblank period, ie. at a time when [4210h].7 is no
longer set).

4211h - TIMEUP - H/V-Timer IRQ Flag (R) (Read/Ack)
  7     H/V-Count Timer IRQ Flag (0=None, 1=Interrupt Request)
  6-0   Not used
The IRQ flag is automatically reset after reading from this register (except
when reading at the very time when the IRQ condition is true (which lasts for
4-8 master cycles), then the CPU receives bit7=1, but register bit7 isn't
cleared). The flag is also automatically cleared when disabling IRQs (by
setting 4200h.Bit5-4 to zero).
Unlike NMI handlers, IRQ handlers MUST acknowledge IRQs, otherwise the IRQ gets
executed again (ie. immediately after the RTI opcode).

4212h - HVBJOY - H/V-Blank flag and Joypad Busy flag (R)
  7     V-Blank Period Flag (0=No, 1=VBlank)
  6     H-Blank Period Flag (0=No, 1=HBlank)
  5-1   Not used
  0     Auto-Joypad-Read Busy Flag (1=Busy) (see 4200h, and 4218h..421Fh)
The Hblank flag gets toggled in ALL scanlines (including during Vblank/Vsync).
Both Vblank and Hblank are always toggling (even during Forced Blank, and no
matter if IRQs or NMIs are enabled).

Other IRQ Sources
IRQs can be also triggered via Cartridge Slot and Expansion Port. This is done
by cartridges with SA-1 and GSU chips.

SNES PPU Resolution
-------------------

Physical Resolution
The physical resolution (of the TV Screen) is:
  256x224 for 60Hz (NTSC) consoles
  256x264 for 50Hz (PAL) consoles
The 50Hz/60Hz cannot be changed by software (it can be only changed by modding
some pins on the mainboard).

Normal Picture Resolution
The vertical resolution is software-selectable, 224 or 239 lines:
  256x224 near-fullscreen on 60Hz (NTSC) consoles (or Tiny Picture at 50Hz)
  256x239 not-really-fullscreen on 50Hz (PAL) consoles (or Overscan at 60Hz)
Most commonly the resolution is selected matching to the frame rate. With 60Hz
Overscan the upper/lower lines are normally not visible (but may be useful to
ensure that there is absolutely no upper/lower border visible, which may be
important for avoiding flickering in interlace mode, especially with bright
pictures; in contrast to the black screen border). 50Hz Tiny Picture would be a
simple solution for porting 224-lines NTSC games to PAL, though it produces
extra-big upper/lower borders.

High-Resolution Modes
There are some methods to double the resolution horizontally and/or vertically:

True High-Resolution (BG Mode 5,6) (optionally with SETINI.0)
...

Pseudo Horizontal High-Resolution (SETINI.3)
...

Pseudo Vertical High-Resolution (SETINI.0) (Interlace)
...

OBJ High-Resolution (SETINI.1)
...

Hires Notes
Horizontal BG Scrolling is always counted in full-pixels; so true-hires cannot
be scrolled in half-pixel units (whilst pseudo hires may be scrolled in
half-pixels by exchanging main/sub-screen layers and using different scroll
offsets for each layer).
Vertical BG Scrolling is counted in half-pixels (only when using true
hv-hires).
Mosaic is always counted in full-pixels; so a mosaic size of 1x1 (which is
normally same as mosaic disabled) acts as 2x1 half-pixels in true h-hires mode
(and as 2x2 half-pixels in true hv-hires mode, reportedly?) (and as 1x2 in
pseudo v-hires, presumably?).
Although h-hires uses main/subscreen for the half-pixels, both main/subscreen
pixels are forced to use Color 0 as backdrop color (rather than using COLDATA
setting as subscreen backdrop) (this applies for both true+pseudo hires).
Window X1/X2 coordinates are always counted in full-pixels (reportedly with an
odd glitch in hires mode?).
OBJ X/Y coordinates are always counted in full-pixels.

Hires Appearance
Horizontal hires may appear blurred on most TV sets (due to the quality of the
video signal and TV-screen, and, when not using a RGB-cable, of the composite
color clock). For example, non-continous white pixels (W) on black background
may appear as gray pixels (g):
  Source Pixels       --->  TV-Screen Pixels
  WW   W   WW   W W         WW   g   WW   ggg
  WWW   W   WW   W W        WWW   g   WW   ggg
To reproduce that by software: CenterPix=(LeftPix+CenterPix*2+RightPix)/4.
Using the above example on a red background looks even worse: the "g" and "ggg"
portions may be barely visible (appear as slightly pastelized red shades).
Vertical hires is producing a flickering image: The scanlines jump up/down
after each frame (and, due to a hardware glitch: the topmost lines also jump
left/right on PAL consoles). The effect is most annoying with hard-contrast
images (eg. black/white text/lines, or bright pixels close to upper/lower
screen borders), it may look less annoying with blurry images (eg. photos, or
anti-alized text/lines). Some modern TV sets might be buffering the even/odd
frames in internal memory, and display them as flicker-free hires image(?)

Notes: Ranma is actually only 256x224 (but does accidentally have interlace
enabled, which causes some totally useless flickering). Jurassic/Kirby are
misusing PseudoH for "blending" the main+sub screen layers (via the blurry TV
picture); this allows to use Color Math for coldata additions (ie. resulting in
3-color blending: main+sub+coldata).

SNES APU Memory and I/O Map
---------------------------

SPC700 Memory Map
  0000h..00EFh  RAM (typically used for CPU pointers/variables)
  00F0h..00FFh  I/O Ports (writes are also passed to RAM)
  0100h..01FFh  RAM (typically used for CPU stack)
  0200h..FFBFh  RAM (code, data, dir-table, brr-samples, echo-buffer, etc.)
  FFC0h..FFFFh  64-byte Boot ROM or RAM (selectable via Port 00F1h)

Audio-related Registers on Main CPU
The main CPU has four write-only 8bit outputs, and (mapped to the same
addresses) four read-only 8bit inputs:
  2140h - APUI00  - Main CPU to Sound CPU Communication Port 0
  2141h - APUI01  - Main CPU to Sound CPU Communication Port 1
  2142h - APUI02  - Main CPU to Sound CPU Communication Port 2
  2143h - APUI03  - Main CPU to Sound CPU Communication Port 3
The registers are used to communicate with Port 00F4h..00F7h on the SPC700 CPU
(on power-up, this is done using a 64-byte BIOS in the SPC700).
Note: All CPU-APU communications are passed through these registers by
software, there are no additional communication methods (like IRQs).

SPC700 I/O Ports
The SPC700 CPU includes 16 memory mapper ports at address 00F0h..00FFh:
  00F0h - TEST    - Testing functions (W)                                  0Ah

DSP Registers
The 128 DSP Registers are indirectly accessed via SPC700 Ports 00F2h/00F3h.
("x" can be 0..7, for selecting one of the 8 voices, or of the 8 filters).

  xFh - FIRx     - Echo FIR filter coefficient 0..7 (R/W)
Register 80h..FFh are read-only mirrors of 00h..7Fh.
Technically, the DSP registers are a RAM-like 128-byte buffer; and are copied
to internal registers when needed. At least some registers (KON and FLG) seem
to have changed-flags (and the buffer-values are processed only when the flag
is set), ENDX seems to be a real register (not using the RAM-like buffer).
Upon Reset, FLG is internally set to E0h (but reading the buffered DSP[6Ch]
value return garbage. The 17 status register are updated (a few cycles after
reset) to ENDX=FFh, ENVx=00h, OUTx=00h. Aside from ENDX/ENVx/OUTx, all other
DSP registers contain garbage. Upon Power-up, that garbage randomly "tends" to
some patterns, but those patterns change from day to day (some examples: one
day all registers were set to 43h, on other days, the eight FIRx were all FFh,
and other registers had whichever values).

APU RAM
Upon power-up, APU RAM tends to contain a stable repeating 64-byte pattern:
32x00h, 32xFFh (that, for APUs with two Motorola MCM51L832F12 32Kx8 SRAM chips;
other consoles may use different chips with different garbage/patterns). After
Reset, the boot ROM changes [0000h..0001h]=Entrypoint, and [0002h..00EFh]=00h).

SNES APU SPC700 CPU Overview
----------------------------

The sound unit is controlled by a S-SMP chip: an 8bit CPU that uses Sony's
SPC700 instruction set. The SPC700's opcodes and it's three main registers
(A,X,Y) are clearly inspired by 6502 instruction set, although the opcodes are
numbered differently, and it has some new/changed instructions.
Aside from the SNES sound processor, the SPC700 is also found in Sony's
CXP8nnnn single-chip microprocessors. Another variant, called SPC700 alpha II,
is also found in their CXP7nnnn chips, which have only 211 opcodes (two less
than the normal SPC700).

  PSW   8bit flags
  YA    16bit combination of Y=MSB, and A=LSB
  PC    16bit program counter

Flags (PSW)
  Bit7  N  Sign Flag          (0=Positive, 1=Negative)

  Bit4  B  Break Flag         (0=Reset, 1=BRK opcode; set <after> BRK opcode)
  Bit3  H  Half-carry         (0=Borrow, or no-carry, 1=Carry, or no-borrow)
  Bit2  I  Interrupt Enable   (0=Disable, 1=Enable) (no function in SNES APU)
  Bit1  Z  Zero Flag          (0=Non-zero, 1=Zero)

Most of the Memory Store opcodes are implemented like ALU opcodes (ie. as RMW
opcodes, issuing a dummy read from the destination address). In result, they
are a bit slower than necessary, and they can trigger read-sensitive I/O ports
(namely the TnOUT registers in the SNES). Only exceptions are opcodes AFh and
FAh (which don't include any dummy read), and opcode DAh (which performs the
dummy read only on the LSB of the 16bit Word).

changed).
Reportedly, TCLR/TSET can access only 0000h..7FFFh, that is nonsense.

Note: The SNES APU doesn't have any interrupt sources, so SLEEP/STOP will hang
the CPU forever, and DI/EI have no effect (other than changing to I-flag in
PSW).

SNES APU SPC700 I/O Ports
-------------------------

00F0h - TEST - Testing functions (W)
  0    Timer-Enable     (0=Normal, 1=Timers don't work)
  1    RAM Write Enable (0=Disable/Read-only, 1=Enable SPC700 & S-DSP writes)
  2    Crash SPC700     (0=Normal, 1=Crashes the CPU)
  3    Timer-Disable    (0=Timers don't work, 1=Normal)
  4-5  Waitstates on RAM Access         (0..3 = 0/1/4/9 cycles) (0=Normal)
  6-7  Waitstates on I/O and ROM Access (0..3 = 0/1/4/9 cycles) (0=Normal)
Default setting is 0Ah, software should never change this register. Normal
memory access time is 1 cycle (adding 0/1/4/9 waits gives access times of
1/2/5/10 cycles). Using 4 or 9 waits doesn't work with some opcodes (0 or 1
waits seem to work stable).
Internal cycles (those that do not access RAM, ROM, nor I/O) are either using
the RAM or I/O access time (see notes at bottom of this chapter).

00F1h - CONTROL - Timer, I/O and ROM Control (W)
  0-2  Timer 0-2 Enable (0=Disable, set TnOUT=0 & reload divider, 1=Enable)
  3    Not used
  4    Reset Port 00F4h/00F5h Input-Latches (0=No change, 1=Reset to 00h)
  5    Reset Port 00F6h/00F7h Input-Latches (0=No change, 1=Reset to 00h)
        Note: The CPUIO inputs are latched inside of the SPC700 (at time when
        the Main CPU writes them), above two bits allow to reset these latches.
  6    Not used
  7    ROM at FFC0h-FFFFh (0=RAM, 1=ROM) (writes do always go to RAM)
On power on or reset, it seems to be set to #$B0.

00F2h - DSPADDR - DSP Register Index (R/W)
  0-7  DSP Register Number (usually 00h..7Fh) (80h..FFh are read-only mirrors)

00F3h - DSPDATA - DSP Register Data (R/W)
  0-7  DSP Register Data (read/write the register selected via Port 00F2h)

00F4h - CPUIO0 - CPU Input and Output Register 0 (R and W)
00F5h - CPUIO1 - CPU Input and Output Register 1 (R and W)
00F6h - CPUIO2 - CPU Input and Output Register 2 (R and W)
00F7h - CPUIO3 - CPU Input and Output Register 3 (R and W)
These registers are used in communication with the 5A22 S-CPU. There are eight
total registers accessed by these four addresses: four write-only output ports
to the S-CPU and four read-only input ports from the S-CPU.
  0-7  Data written to/read from corresponding register on main 5A22 CPU
If the SPC700 writes to an output port while the S-CPU is reading it, the S-CPU
will read the logical OR of the old and new values. Possibly the same thing
happens the other way around, but the details are unknown?

00F8h - AUXIO4 - External I/O Port P4 (S-SMP Pins 34-27) (R/W) (unused)
00F9h - AUXIO5 - External I/O Port P5 (S-SMP Pins 25-18) (R/W) (unused)
Writing changes the output levels. Reading normally returns the same value as
the written value; unless external hardware has pulled the pins LOW or HIGH.
Reading from AUXIO5 additionally produces a short /P5RD read signal (Pin17).
  0-7  Input/Output levels (0=Low, 1=High)
In the SNES, these pins are unused (not connected), so the registers do
effectively work as if they'd be "RAM-like" general purpose storage registers.

00FAh - T0DIV - Timer 0 Divider (for 8000Hz clock source) (W)
00FBh - T1DIV - Timer 1 Divider (for 8000Hz clock source) (W)
00FCh - T2DIV - Timer 2 Divider (for 64000Hz clock source) (W)
  0-7  Divider (01h..FFh=Divide by 1..255, or 00h=Divide by 256)
If timers are enabled (via Port 00F1h), then the TnOUT registers are
incremented at the selected rate (ie. the 8kHz or 64kHz clock source, divided
by the selected value).

00FDh - T0OUT - Timer 0 Output (R)
00FEh - T1OUT - Timer 1 Output (R)
00FFh - T2OUT - Timer 2 Output (R)
  0-3  Incremented at the rate selected via TnDIV (reset to 0 after reading)
  4-7  Not used (always zero)

SPC700 Waitstates on Internal Cycles
Below lists the number of I/O-Waitstates applied on Internal Cycles of SPC700
opcodes 00h..FFh (that implies: any further Internal Cycles have
RAM-Waitstates).

  E0..FF  0,3,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0, 0,3,0,3,1,1,1,1,0,1,0,1,0,0,3,0
  Note: For conditional jumps (with condition=true), add 2 additional cylces.
That is, the above list_entries are meant to be used like so:
  number_of_I/O_waits = list_entry
  number_of_RAM_waits = total_number_of_internal_cycles - list_entry
For example, Opcode 00h (NOP) has one internal cycle (and it's having RAM
timings). Opcode 01h (TCALL) has 3 internal cycles (and all 3 of them have I/O
timings).

SNES APU Main CPU Communication Port
------------------------------------

2140h - APUI00  - Main CPU to Sound CPU Communication Port 0 (R/W)
2141h - APUI01  - Main CPU to Sound CPU Communication Port 1 (R/W)
2142h - APUI02  - Main CPU to Sound CPU Communication Port 2 (R/W)
2143h - APUI03  - Main CPU to Sound CPU Communication Port 3 (R/W)
  7-0   APU I/O Data   (Write: Data to APU, Read: Data from APU)
Caution: These registers should be written only in 8bit mode (there is a
hardware glitch that can cause a 16bit write to [2140h..2141h] to destroy
[2143h], this might happen only in some situations, like when the cartridge
contains too many ROM chips which apply too much load on the bus).

  Wait until Byte[2140h]=kick   ;wait for acknowledge
CAUTION: The acknowledge for the last data byte lasts only for a few clock
cycles, if the uploader is too slow then it may miss it (for example if it's
interrupted); as a workaround, disable IRQs and NMIs during upload, or replace
the last "wait for ack" by hardcoded delay.

SNES APU DSP BRR Samples
------------------------

x4h - VxSRCN - Source number for Voice 0..7 (R/W)
  0-7   Instrument number (index in DIR table)
Points to the BRR Start & Loop addresses (via a table entry at
VxSRCN*4+DIR*100h), used when voices are Keyed-ON or Looped.

5dh - DIR - Sample table address (R/W)
  0-7   Sample Table Address (in 256-byte steps) (indexed via VxSRCN)
The table can contain up to 256 four-byte entries (max 1Kbyte). Each entry is:
  Byte 0-1  BRR Start Address (used when voice is Keyed-ON)
  Byte 2-3  BRR Restart/Loop Address (used when end of BRR data reached)
Changing DIR or VxSRCN has no immediate effect (until/unless voices are newly
Looped or Keyed-ON).

Bit Rate Reduction (BRR) Format
The sample data consists of 9-byte block(s). The first byte of each block is:
  7-4  Shift amount   (0=Silent, 12=Loudest, 13-15=Reserved)
  3-2  Filter number  (0=None, 1..3=see below)
  1-0  Loop/End flags (0..3=see below)
The next 8 bytes contain two samples (or nibbles) each:
  7-4  First Sample  (signed -8..+7)
  3-0  Second Sample (signed -8..+7)
The Loop/End bits can have following values:
  Code 0 = Normal   (continue at next 9-byte block)
  Code 1 = End+Mute (jump to Loop-address, set ENDx flag, Release, Env=000h)
  Code 2 = Ignored  (same as Code 0)
  Code 3 = End+Loop (jump to Loop-address, set ENDx flag)
The Shift amount is used to convert the 4bit nibbles to 15bit samples:
  sample = (nibble SHL shift) SAR 1
  Accordingly, shift=0 is rather useless (since it strips the low bit).
  When shift=13..15, decoding works as if shift=12 and nibble=(nibble SAR 3).
The Filter bits allow to select the following filter modes:
  Filter 0: new = sample
  Filter 1: new = sample + old*0.9375
  Filter 2: new = sample + old*1.90625  - older*0.9375
  Filter 3: new = sample + old*1.796875 - older*0.8125
More precisely, the exact formulas are:
  Filter 0: new = sample
  Filter 1: new = sample + old*1+((-old*1) SAR 4)
  Filter 2: new = sample + old*2+((-old*3) SAR 5)  - older+((older*1) SAR 4)
  Filter 3: new = sample + old*2+((-old*13) SAR 6) - older+((older*3) SAR 4)
When creating BRR data, take care that "new" does never exceed -3FFAh..+3FF8h,
otherwise a number of hardware glitches will occur:
  If new>+7FFFh then new=+7FFFh (but, clipped to +3FFFh below) ;\clamp 16bit
  If new<-8000h then new=-8000h (but, clipped to ZERO below)   ;/(dirt-effect)
  If new=(+4000h..+7FFFh) then new=(-4000h..-1)                ;\clip 15bit
  If new=(-8000h..-4001h) then new=(-0..-3FFFh)                ;/(lost-sign)
  If new>+3FF8h OR new<-3FFAh then overflows can occur in Gauss section
The resulting 15bit "new" value is then passed to the Gauss filter, and
additionally re-used for the next 1-2 sample(s) as "older=old, old=new".

BRR Notes
The first 9-byte BRR sample block should always use Filter 0 (so it isn't
disturbed by uninitialized old/older values). Same for the first block at the
Loop address (unless the old/older values of the initial-pass should happen to
match the ending values of the looped-passes).

SNES APU DSP BRR Pitch
------------------------

x2h - VxPITCHL - Pitch scaler for Voice 0..7, lower 8bit (R/W)
x3h - VxPITCHH - Pitch scaler for Voice 0..7, upper 6bit (R/W)
  0-13  Sample rate (0=stop, 3FFFh=fastest) (1000h = 32000Hz)
  14-15 Not used (read/write-able)
Defines the BRR sample rate. This register (and PMON) does affect only the BRR
sample frequency (but not on the Noise frequency, which is defined - and shared
for all voices - in the FLG register).

2dh - PMON - Pitch Modulation Enable Flags for Voice 1..7 (R/W)
Pitch modulation allows to generate "Frequency Sweep" effects by mis-using the
amplitude from channel (x-1) as pitch factor for channel (x).
  0    Not used
  1-7  Flags for Voice 1..7 (0=Normal, 1=Modulate by Voice 0..6)
For example, output a very loud 1Hz sine-wave on channel 4 (with Direct
Gain=40h, and with Left/Right volume=0; unless you actually want to output it
to the speaker). Then additionally output a 2kHz sine wave on channel 5 with
PMON.Bit5 set. The "2kHz" sound should then repeatedly sweep within 1kHz..3kHz
range (or, for a more decent sweep in 1.8kHz..2.2kHz range, drop the Gain level
of channel 4).

Pitch Counter
The pitch counter is adjusted at 32000Hz rate as follows:
  Step = VxPitch                   ;range 0..3FFFh (0..128 kHz)
  IF PMON.Bit(x)=1 AND (x>0)       ;pitch modulation enable
    Factor = VxOUTX(x-1)           ;range -4000h..+3FFFh (prev voice amplitude)
    Factor = (Factor SAR 4)+400h   ;range +000h..+7FFh (factor = 0.00 .. 1.99)
    Step = (Step * Factor) SAR 10  ;range 0..7FEEh (0..256 kHz)
 XXX somewhere here, STEP (or the COUNTER-RESULT) is cropped to 128kHz max) XX?
  Counter = Counter + Step         ;range 0..FFFFh, carry=next BRR block
Counter.Bit15-12 indicates the current sample (within a BRR block).
Counter.Bit11-3 are used as gaussian interpolation index.

Maximum Sound Frequency
The pitch counter generates sample rates up to 128kHz. However, the Mixer and
DAC are clocked at 32kHz, so the higher rates will skip (or interpolate)
samples rather than outputting all samples.
The 32kHz output rate means that one can produce max 16kHz tones.

4-Point Gaussian Interpolation
Interpolation is applied on the 4 most recent 15bit BRR samples
(new,old,older,oldest), using bit4-11 of the pitch counter as interpolation
index (i=00h..FFh):
  out =       ((gauss[0FFh-i] * oldest) SAR 10) ;-initial 16bit value
  out = out + ((gauss[1FFh-i] * older)  SAR 10) ;-no 16bit overflow handling
  out = out + ((gauss[100h+i] * old)    SAR 10) ;-no 16bit overflow handling
  out = out + ((gauss[000h+i] * new)    SAR 10) ;-with 16bit overflow handling
  out = out SAR 1                               ;-convert 16bit result to 15bit
The Gauss table contains the following values (in hex):
  000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000  ;\

The gauss table is slightly bugged: Theoretically, each four values
(gauss[000h+i], gauss[0FFh-i], gauss[100h+i], gauss[1FFh-i]) should sum up to
800h, but in practice they do sum up to 7FFh..801h. Of which, 801h can cause
math overflows. For example, when outputting three or more "-8 SHL 12" BRR
samples with Filter 0, some interpolation results will be +3FF8h (instead of
-4000h).
When adding the four new,old,older,oldest values there's some partial overflow
handling: The 1st addition can't overflow, the 2nd addition can overflow (when
i=0..1Fh), the 3rd addition can overflow (when i=20h..FFh). Of which, the 2nd
one bugs, the 3rd one is saturated to Min=-8000h/Max=+7FFFh (giving
-4000h/+3FFFh after the final SAR 1).

SNES APU DSP ADSR/Gain Envelope
-------------------------------

x5h - VxADSR1 - ADSR settings for Voice 0..7, lower 8bit (R/W)
x6h - VxADSR2 - ADSR settings for Voice 0..7, upper 8bit (R/W)
  0-3   4bit Attack rate   ;Rate=N*2+1, Step=+32 (or Step=+1024 when Rate=31)
  4-6   3bit Decay rate    ;Rate=N*2+16, Step=-(((Level-1) SAR 8)+1)
  7     ADSR/Gain Select   ;0=Use VxGAIN, 1=Use VxADSR (Attack/Decay/Sustain)
  8-12  5bit Sustain rate  ;Rate=N, Step=-(((Level-1) SAR 8)+1)
  13-15 3bit Sustain level ;Boundary=(N+1)*100h
  N/A   0bit Release rate  ;Rate=31, Step=-8 (or Step=-800h when BRR-end)
If a voice is Keyed-ON: Enter Attack mode, set Level=0, and increase level. At
Level>=7E0h: Switch from Attack to Decay mode (and clip level to max=7FFh if
level>=800h). At Level<=Boundary: Switch from Decay to Sustain mode.
If the voice is Keyed-OFF (or the BRR sample contains the Key-Off flag): Switch
from Attack/Decay/Sustain/Gain mode to Release mode.

x7h - VxGAIN - Gain settings for Voice 0..7 (R/W)
When VxADSR1.Bit7=1 (Attack/Decay/Sustain Mode):
  0-7   Not used (instead, Attack/Decay/Sustain parameters are used)
When VxADSR1.Bit7=0 and VxGAIN.Bit7=0 (Direct Gain):
  0-6   Fixed Volume (Envelope Level = N*16, Rate=Infinite)  ;Volume=N*16/800h
  7     Must be 0 for this mode
When VxADSR1.Bit7=0 and VxGAIN.Bit7=1 (Custom Gain):
  0-4   Gain rate (Rate=N)
  5-6   Gain mode (see below)
  7     Must be 1 for this mode
In the latter case, the four Gain Modes are:
  Mode 0 = Linear Decrease  ;Rate=N, Step=-32  (if Level<0 then Level=0)
  Mode 1 = Exp Decrease     ;Rate=N, Step=-(((Level-1) SAR 8)+1)
  Mode 2 = Linear Increase  ;Rate=N, Step=+32
  Mode 3 = Bent Increase    ;Rate=N, If Level<600h then Step=+32 else Step=+8
  In all cases, clip E to 0 or 0x7ff rather than wrapping.
The Direct/Custom Gain modes are overriding Attack/Decay/Sustain modes (when
Keyed-ON), Release (when Keyed-OFF) keeps working as usually.

x8h - VxENVX - Current envelope value for Voice 0..7 (R)
  0-6  Upper 7bit of the 11bit envelope volume (0..127)
  7    Not used (zero)
Technically, this register IS writable. But whatever value you write will be
overwritten at 32000 Hz.

x9h - VxOUTX - Current sample value for Voice 0..7 (R)
This returns the high byte of the current sample for this voice, after envelope
volume adjustment but before VxVOL[LR] is applied.
  0-7  Upper 8bit of the current 15bit sample value (-128..+127)
Technically, this register IS writable. But whatever value you write will be
overwritten at 32000 Hz.

ADSR/Gain (and Noise) Rates
The various ADSR/Gain/Noise rates are defined as 5bit rate values (or 3bit/4bit
values which are converted to 5bit values as described above). The meaning of
these 5bit values is as follows (the table shows the number of 32000Hz sample
units it takes until the next Step is applied):
  00h=Stop   04h=1024  08h=384   0Ch=160   10h=64   14h=24   18h=10   1Ch=4
  01h=2048   05h=768   09h=320   0Dh=128   11h=48   15h=20   19h=8    1Dh=3
  02h=1536   06h=640   0Ah=256   0Eh=96    12h=40   16h=16   1Ah=6    1Eh=2
  03h=1280   07h=512   0Bh=192   0Fh=80    13h=32   17h=12   1Bh=5    1Fh=1
Note: All values are "1,3,5 SHL n". Hardware-wise they are probably implemented
as 3bit counters, driven at 32kHz, 16kHz, 8kKz, etc. (depending on the shift
amount); accordingly, when entering a new ADSR phase, the location of the 1st
step may vary depending on when the hardware generates the next 8kHz cycles,
for example.

Gain Notes
Even in Gain modes, the hardware does internally keep track of whether it is in
Attack/Decay/Sustain phase: In attack phase it switches to Decay at
Level>=7E0h. In Decay phase it switches to Sustain at Level<=Boundary (though
accidently reading a garbage boundary value from VxGAIN.Bit7-5 instead of from
VxADSR2.Bit7-5). Whereas, switching phases doesn't have any audible effect, it
just marks the hardware as being in a new phase (and, if software disables
Gain-Mode by setting VxADSR1.Bit7, then hardware will process the current
phase).
Direct Gain mode can be used to set a fixed volume, or to define the starting
point for a different mode (in the latter case, mind that the hardware
processes I/O ports only once per sample, so, after setting Direct Gain mode:
wait at least 32 cpu cycles before selecting a different mode).

Misc Notes
  Save the new value, *clipped* to 11 bits, to determine the
  increment for GAIN Bent Increase mode next sample. Note that a
  negative value for the new value will result in the clipped
  version being greater than 0x600.

SNES APU DSP Volume Registers
-----------------------------

0Ch - MVOLL - Left channel master volume (R/W)
1Ch - MVOLR - Right channel master volume (R/W)
  0-7   Volume (-127..+127) (negative = phase inverted) (sample=sample*vol/128)
Value -128 causes multiply overflows (-8000h*-80h=-400000h).

x0h - VxVOLL - Left volume for Voice 0..7 (R/W)
x1h - VxVOLR - Right volume for Voice 0..7 (R/W)
  0-7   Volume (-128..+127) (negative = phase inverted) (sample=sample*vol/128)
Value -128 can be safely used (unlike as for all other volume registers, there
is no overflow; because ADSR/Gain does lower the incoming sample to
max=sample*7FFh/800h).

SNES APU DSP Control Registers
------------------------------

4Ch - KON - Key On Flags for Voice 0..7 (R/W) (W)
  0-7  Flags for Voice 0..7 (0=No change, 1=Key On)

        Writing 1 to the KON bit will set the envelope to 0, the state to
        Attack, and will start the channel from the beginning (see DIR and
        VxSRCN). Note that this happens even if the channel is already playing
        (which may cause a click/pop), and that there are 5 'empty' samples
        before envelope updates and BRR decoding actually begin.

5Ch - KOFF - Key Off Flags for Voice 0..7 (R/W) (W)
  0-7  Flags for Voice 0..7 (0=No change, 1=Key Off)

        Setting 1 to the KOFF bit will transition the voice to the Release
        state. Thus, the envelope will decrease by 8 every sample (regardless
        of the VxADSR and VxGAIN settings) until it reaches 0, where it will
        stay until the next KON.

6Ch - FLG - Reset, Mute, Echo-Write flags and Noise Clock (R/W)
The initial value on Reset is E0h (KeyedOff/Muted/EchoWriteOff/NoiseStopped),
although reading the FLG register after reset will return a garbage value.
  0-4  Noise frequency    (0=Stop, 1=16Hz, 2=21Hz, ..., 1Eh=16kHz, 1Fh=32kHz)
  5    Echo Buffer Writes (0=Enable, 1=Disable) (doesn't disable echo-reads)
  6    Mute Amplifier     (0=Normal, 1=Mute) (doesn't stop internal processing)
  7    Soft Reset         (0=Normal, 1=KeyOff all voices, and set Envelopes=0)
Disabling Echo-Writes doesn't affect Echo-Reads (ie. echo buffer is still
output, unless Echo Volume L+R or FIR0..7 are set to zero). Mute affects only
the external amplifier (internally all sound/echo generation is kept
operating).

7Ch - ENDX - Voice End Flags for Voice 0..7 (R) (W=Ack)
  0-7  Flags for Voice 0..7 (0=Keyed ON, 1=BRR-End-Bit encountered)
Any write to this register will clear ALL bits, no matter what value is
written. On reset, all bits are cleared. Though bits may get set shortly after
reset or shortly after manual-write (once when the BRR decoder reaches an
End-code).
        Note that the bit is set at the START of decoding the BRR block, not
        at the end. Recall that BRR processing, and therefore the setting of
        bits in this register, continues even for voices in the Release state.

3Dh - NON - Noise Enable Flags for Voice 0..7 (R/W)
Allows to enable Noise on one or more channels, however, there is only one
noise-generator (and only one noise frequency) shared for all voices. The 5bit
noise frequency is defined in FLG register (see above), and works same as the
5bit ADSR rates (see ADSR chapter for details). The NON bits are:
  0-7  Flags for Voice 0..7 (0=Output BRR Samples, 1=Output Noise)
The noise generator produces 15bit output level (range -4000h..+3FFFh;
initially -4000h after reset). At the selected noise rate, the level is updated
as follows:
  Level = ((Level SHR 1) AND 3FFFh) OR ((Level.Bit0 XOR Level.Bit1) SHL 14)
Caution: Even in noise mode, the hardware keeps decoding BRR sample blocks,
and, when hitting a BRR block with End Code 1 (End+Mute), it will switch to
Release state with Envelope=0, thus immediately terminating the Noise output.
To avoid that, set VxSRCN to an endless looping dummy BRR block.
Note: The VxPITCH registers have no effect on noise frequency, and Gaussian
interpolation isn't applied on noise.

KON/KOFF Notes
        These registers seem to be polled only at 16000 Hz, when every other
        sample is due to be output. Thus, if you write two values in close
        succession, usually but not always only the second value will have an
        effect:
          ; assume KOFF = 0, but no voices playing
          mov $f2, #$4c  ; KON = 1 then KON = 2
          mov $f3, #$01  ; -> *usually* only voice 2 is keyed on. If both are,
          mov $f3, #$02  ; voice 1 will be *2* samples ahead rather than one.
        and
          ; assume various voices playing
          mov $f2, #$5c  ; KOFF = $ff then KOFF = 0
          mov $f3, #$ff
          mov $f3, #$00  ; -> *usually* all voices remain playing
        FLG bit 7, however, is polled every sample and polled for each voice.

        These registers and FLG bit 7 interact as follows:
          1. If FLG bit 7 or the KOFF bit for the channel is set, transition
             to the Release state. If FLG bit 7 is set, also set the envelope
             to 0.
          2. If the 'internal' value of KON has the channel's bit set, perform
             the KON actions described above.
          3. Set the 'internal' value of KON to 0.

        This has a number of consequences:
          * KON effectively takes effect 'on write', even though a non-zero
            value can be read back much later. KOFF and FLG.7, on the other
            hand, exert their influence constantly until a new value is
            written.
          * Writing KON while KOFF or FLG.7 will not result in any samples
            being output by the channel. The channel is keyed on, but it is
            turned off again 2 samples later. Since there is a 5 sample delay
            after KON before the channel actually beings processing, the net
            effect is no output.
          * However, if KOFF is cleared within 63 SPC700 cycles of the
            KON write above, the channel WILL be keyed on as normal. If KOFF
            is cleared betwen 64 and 127 SPC700 cycles later, the channel
            MIGHT be keyed on with decreasing probability depending on how
            many cycles before the KON/KOFF poll the KON write occurred.
          * Setting both KOFF and KON for a channel will turn the channel
            off much faster than just KOFF alone, since the KON will set the
            envelope to 0. This can cause a click/pop, though.

xAh - NA - Unused (8 bytes of general-purpose RAM) (R/W)
xBh - NA - Unused (8 bytes of general-purpose RAM) (R/W)
1Dh - NA - Unused (1 byte of general-purpose RAM) (R/W)
xEh - NA - Unused (8 bytes of general-purpose RAM) (R/W)
These registers seem to have no function at all. Data written to them seems to
have no effect on sound output, the written values seem to be left intact (ie.
they aren't overwritten by voice or echo status information).

SNES APU DSP Echo Registers
---------------------------

2Ch - EVOLL - Left channel echo volume (R/W)
3Ch - EVOLR - Right channel echo volume (R/W)
  0-7   Volume (-128..+127) (negative = phase inverted) (sample=sample*vol/128)
This is the adjustment applied to the FIR filter outputs before mixing with the
main signal (after master volume adjustment).

0Dh - EFB - Echo feedback volume (R/W)
Specifies the feedback volume (the volume at which the echo-output is mixed
back to the echo-input).
  0-7   Volume (-128..+127) (negative = phase inverted) (sample=sample*vol/128)
Medium values (like 40h) produce "normal" echos (with decreasing volume on each
repetition). Value 00h would produce a one-shot echo, value 7Fh would repeat
the echo almost infinitely (assuming that FIRx leaves the overall volume
unchanged).

4Dh - EON - Echo Enable Flags for Voice 0..7 (R/W)
  0-7  Flags for Voice 0..7 (0=Direct Output, 1=Echo (and Direct) Output)
When the bit is set and echo buffer write is enabled, this voice will be mixed
into the sample to be written to the echo buffer for later echo processing.

6Dh - ESA - Echo ring buffer address (R/W)
  0-7   Echo Buffer Base Address (in 256-byte steps)
The echo buffer consists of one or more 4-byte entries:
  Byte 0: Lower 7bit of Left sample  (stored in bit1-7) (bit0=unused/zero)
  Byte 1: Upper 8bit of Left sample  (stored in bit0-7)
  Byte 2: Lower 7bit of Right sample (stored in bit1-7) (bit0=unused/zero)
  Byte 3: Upper 8bit of Right sample (stored in bit0-7)
At 32000Hz rate, the oldest 4-byte entry is removed (and passed on to the FIR
filter), and, if echo-writes are enabled in FLG register, the removed entry is
then overwritten by new values (from the Echo Mixer; consisting of all Voices
enabled in EON, plus echo feedback).
Changes to the ESA register are are realized (almost) immediately: After
changing ESA, the hardware may keep access 1-2 samples at [OldBase+index], and
does then continue at [NewBase+index] (with index being increased as usually,
or reset to 0 when Echo Size has ellapsed).

7Dh - EDL - Echo delay (ring buffer size) (R/W)
Specifies the size of the Echo RAM buffer (and thereby the echo delay).
Additionally to that RAM buffer, there is a 8x4-byte buffer in the FIR unit.
  0-3  Echo Buffer Size (0=4 bytes, or 1..15=Size in 2K-byte steps) (max=30K)
  4-7  Not used (read/write-able)                (ie. 16 ms steps) (max=240ms)
Caution: It may take up to about 240ms until the hardware realizes changes to
the EDL register; ie. when re-allocating the buffer size, the hardware may keep
writing up to 30Kbytes according to the old size. See Echo Buffer Notes below.

Echo Buffer Notes
        Note that the ESA register is accessed 32 cycles before the value is
        used for a write; at a sample level, this causes writes to appear to be
        delayed by at least a full sample before taking effect.

        The EDL register value is only used under certain conditions:
         * Write the echo buffer at sample 'idx' (cycles 29 and 30)
         * If idx==0, set idx_max = EDL<<9       (cycle 30-ish)
         * Increment idx. If idx>=idx_max, idx=0 (cycle 30-ish)
        This means that it can take up to .25s for a newly written value to
        actually take effect, if the old value was 0x0f and the new value is
        written just after the cycle 30 in which buffer index 0 was written.

xFh - FIRx - Echo FIR filter coefficient 0..7 (R/W)
  0-7  Echo Coefficient for 8-tap FIR filter (-80h..+7Fh)
Value -128 should not be used for any of the FIRx registers (to avoid multiply
overflows). To avoid addition overflows: The sum of POSITIVE values in first
seven registers (FIR0..FIR6) should not exceed +7Fh, and the sum of NEGATIVE
values should not exceed -7Fh.
The sum of all eight registers (FIR0..FIR7) should be usually around +80h (for
leaving the overall output volume unchanged by the FIR unit; instead, echo
volumes are usually adjusted via EFB/EVOLx registers).
The FIR formula is:
  addr = (ESA*100h+ram_index*4) AND FFFFh           ;-Echo RAM read/write addr
  buf[(i-0) AND 7] = EchoRAM[addr] SAR 1            ;-input 15bit from Echo RAM
  sum =       buf[(i-7) AND 7]*FIR0 SAR 6  ;oldest  ;\
  sum = sum + buf[(i-6) AND 7]*FIR1 SAR 6           ; calculate 16bit sum of
  sum = sum + buf[(i-5) AND 7]*FIR2 SAR 6           ; oldest 7 values, these
  sum = sum + buf[(i-4) AND 7]*FIR3 SAR 6           ; additions are done
  sum = sum + buf[(i-3) AND 7]*FIR4 SAR 6           ; without overflow

Note: The "bugged" example (with the sum of FIR0..FIR6 exceeding +7Fh) is from
official (!) specs (and thus possibly actually used by some games(?)).

Echo Overflows
Setting FIRx, EFB, or EVOLx to -128 does probably cause multiply overflows?

On every CPU cycle, the hardware can access 3 bytes from RAM (2 DSP accesses,
and 1 CPU access), and 4 bytes from DSP Register Array (3 DSP accesses, and 1
CPU access), plus some special DSP Registers (ENDX/FLG). Audio is generated at
32000Hz Rate (every 32 CPU cycles):

SNES Maths Multiply/Divide
--------------------------

4202h - WRMPYA - Set unsigned 8bit Multiplicand (W)
4203h - WRMPYB - Set unsigned 8bit Multiplier and Start Multiplication (W)
Set WRMPYA (or leave it unchanged, if it already contains the desired value),
then set WRMPYB, wait 8 clk cycles, then read the 16bit result from Port
4216h-4217h. For some reason, the hardware does additionally set RDDIVL=WRMPYB,
and RDDIVH=00h.

4204h - WRDIVL - Set unsigned 16bit Dividend (lower 8bit) (W)
4205h - WRDIVH - Set unsigned 16bit Dividend (upper 8bit) (W)
4206h - WRDIVB - Set unsigned 8bit Divisor and Start Division (W)
Set WRDIVL/WRDIVH (or leave it unchanged, if it already contains the desired
value), then set WRDIVB, wait 16 clk cycles, then read the 16bit result and/or
16bit remainder from Port 4214h-4217h.
Division by zero returns Result=FFFFh, Remainder=Dividend. Note: Almost all
commercial SNES games are zero-filling I/O ports upon initialization, thereby
causing division by zero (so, debuggers should ignore division errors).

4214h - RDDIVL - Unsigned Division Result (Quotient) (lower 8bit) (R)
4215h - RDDIVH - Unsigned Division Result (Quotient) (upper 8bit) (R)
See Ports 4204h-4206h (divide). Destroyed by 4203h (multiply).

4216h - RDMPYL - Unsigned Division Remainder / Multiply Product (lo.8bit) (R)
4217h - RDMPYH - Unsigned Division Remainder / Multiply Product (up.8bit) (R)
See Ports 4204h-4206h (divide), and 4202h-4203h (multiply).

Timing Notes
The 42xxh Ports are clocked by the CPU Clock, meaning that one needs the same
amount of "wait" opcodes no matter if the CPU Clock is 3.5MHz or 2.6MHz. When
reading the result, the "MOV r,[421xh]" opcode does include 3 cycles (spent on
reading the 3-byte opcode), meaning that one needs to insert only 5 cycles for
MUL and only 13 for DIV.
Some special cases: If the the upper "N" bits of 4202h are all zero, then it
seems that one may wait "N" cycles less. If memory REFRESH occurs (once and
when), then the result seems to be valid with even less wait opcodes.
The maths operations are started only on WRMPYB/WRDIVB writes (not on
WRMPYA/WRDIVL/WRDIVH writes; unlike the PPU maths which start on any M7A/M7B
write).

=== PPU Ports ===

Below Ports 21xxh are PPU registers. The registers are also used for
rotation/scaling effects in BG Mode 7. In BG Mode 0-6 they can be used freely
for multiplications. In Mode 7 they are usable ONLY during V-Blank and
Forced-Blank (during the Mode 7 Drawing & H-Blank periods, they return garbage
in MPYL/MPYM/MPYH, and of course writing math-parameters to M7A/M7B would also
mess-up the display).

211Bh - M7A - Rotation/Scaling Parameter A (and Maths 16bit operand) (W)
  1st Write: Lower 8bit of signed 16bit Multiplicand  ;\1st/2nd write mechanism
  2nd Write: Upper 8bit of signed 16bit Multiplicand  ;/uses "M7_old" (Mode7)

211Ch - M7B - Rotation/Scaling Parameter B (and Maths 8bit operand) (W)
  Any Write: Signed 8bit Multiplier                   ;-also affects "M7_old"
After writing to 211Bh or 211Ch, the result can be read immediately from
2134h-2136h (the 21xxh Ports are rapidly clocked by the PPU, there's no delay
needed when reading via "MOV A,[211Ch]" or via "MOV A,[1Ch]" (with D=2100h),
both works even when the CPU runs at 3.5MHz).

2134h - MPYL - Signed Multiply Result (lower 8bit) (R)
2135h - MPYM - Signed Multiply Result (middle 8bit) (R)
2136h - MPYH - Signed Multiply Result (upper 8bit) (R)
See Ports 211Bh-211Ch.

Before reading above ports, set Bit 0 in port 4200h to request automatic
reading, then wait until Bit 0 of port 4212h gets set-or-cleared? Once 4200h
enabled, seems to be automatically read on every retrace?
Be sure that Out0 in Port 4016h is zero (otherwise the shift register gets
stuck on the first bit, ie. all 16bit will be equal to the B-button state.

 AUTO JOYPAD READ
 ----------------
 When enabled, the SNES will read 16 bits from each of the 4 controller port
 data lines into registers $4218-f. This begins between H=32.5 and H=95.5 of
 the first V-Blank scanline, and ends 4224 master cycles later. Register $4212
 bit 0 is set during this time. Specifically, it begins at H=74.5 on the first
 frame, and thereafter some multiple of 256 cycles after the start of the
 previous read that falls within the observed range.

 Reading $4218-f during this time will read back incorrect values. The only
 reliable value is that no buttons pressed will return 0 (however, if buttons
 are pressed 0 could still be returned incorrectly). Presumably reading $4016/7
 or writing $4016 during this time will also screw things up.

Wires are connected to IO-0..5, but the wires disappear somewhere in the
multi-layer board (and might be dead-ends), none of them is output to any
connectors (not to the Controller ports, not to the cartridge slot, and not to

These strings were included in Nintendo's hardware driver source code files,
the strings themselves have no function (so one could simply remove them), but
Nintendo prompted developers to keep them included. They are typically arranged
like so:
  "START OF xxx BIOS"
  [bios program code...]
  "NINTENDO SHVC xxx BIOS VER x.xx"
  "END OF xxx BIOS"
Whereas, the version string may be preceeded by "MODIFIED FROM ", and "VER" may
be "Ver" in some cases, sometimes without space between "Ver" and "x.xx". In
case of custom code one may omit the version string or replace it by "MY BIOS
VERSION" or so, but one should include the "START/END OF xxx BIOS" strings to
ease detection.

Multiplayer 5
Games that do SUPPORT the hardware should contain following string:
  "START OF MULTI5 BIOS"
Games that do DETECT the hardware should contain following string:
  "START OF MULTI5 CONNECT CHECK"
Games that contain only the "CHECK" part (but not the "BIOS" part) may REJECT
to operate with the hardware.
Some MP5 games (eg. "Battle Cross") do lack the "START OF ..." strings.

Mouse
Games that do SUPPORT the hardware should contain following string:
  "START OF MOUSE BIOS"
Some Mouse games (eg. Arkanoid Doh It Again) do lack the "START OF ..."
strings. For such games, checking following opcodes may help:
  MOV Y,0Ah/LOP:/MOV A,[(00)4016h+X]/DEC Y/JNZ LOP/MOV A,[(00)4016h+X]
The official mouse BIOS uses 24bit "004016h+X" (BF 16 40 00), Arkanoid uses
16bit "4016h+X" (BD 16 40).

SuperScope
Games that do SUPPORT the hardware should (but usually don't) contain following
string:
  "START OF SCOPE BIOS"
In practice, the string is included only in "Yoshi's Safari" whilst all other
(older and newer) games contain entirely custom differently implemented program
code without ID strings, making it more or less impossible to detect SuperScope
support. One workaround would be to check known Title strings:
  "BATTLE CLASH         "    "METAL COMBAT         "    "T2 ARCADE            "
  "BAZOOKA BLITZKRIEG   "    "OPERATION THUNDERBOLT"    "TINSTAR              "
  "Hunt for Red October "    "SPACE BAZOOKA        "    "X ZONE               "
  "LAMBORGHINI AMERICAN "    "SUPER SCOPE 6        "    "YOSHI'S SAFARI       "

Lasabirdie
Games that do support the hardware should contain "GOLF_READY!" string (used to
verify the ID received from the hardware).

Turbo File Twin in STF Mode
Games that do support the hardware should contain "FAT0" and SHVC" strings,
which are usually (maybe always) stored as continous "FAT0SHVC" string.

Turbo File Twin in TFII Mode or Turbo File Adapter
There aren't any specific ASCII Strings. However, most (or all) games contain
the "MOV Y,000F, MOV A,[004017], DEC Y, JNZ $-5" opcode sequence (exactly like
so, ie. with Y=16bit, and address=24bit).

NSRT Header
Some ROM-images do contain information about supported controllers in NSRT
Headers. In practice, most ROM-images don't have that header (but can be
"upgraded" by Nach's NSRT tool).
--> SNES Cartridge ROM-Image Headers and File Extensions
The NSRT format isn't officially documented. The official way to create headers
seems to be to contact the author (Nach), ask him to add controller flags for a
specific game, download the updated version of the NSRT tool, use it to update
your ROM-image, and then maybe you have the header.

SNES Controllers Mouse (Two-button Mouse)
-----------------------------------------

Mouse Connection
The mouse can be connected to Controller Port 1 or 2. Default seems to be Port
1 for most games. Exception: Satellaview FLASH games should default to Port 2
(the joypad controlled BS-X BIOS doesn't work with mouse plugged into Port 1).
Mario Paint accepts it ONLY in Port 1, other games may accept either port
(maybe there are also some that accept only Port 2?). Two-player games (eg.
Operation Thunderbolt) may accept two mice to be connected. Some games (eg.
Super Bomberman Panic Bomber World) refuse to run if a mouse is connected. The
mouse should not be connected to Multiplayer 5 adaptors (which allow only 17mA
per controller, whilst the mouse requires 50mA).

  32th         Horizontal Offset Bit0 (0=High=Zero)    ;/
  33th and up  Padding      (always 1=Low)
Note that the motion values consist of a Direction Bit and an UNSIGNED 7bit
offset (ie. not a signed 8bit value). After reading, the 7bit offsets are
automatically reset to zero (whilst the direction bits do reportedly stay
unchanged unless/until the mouse is moved in opposite direction).

Mouse Support ID-String
Games that support the mouse should contain the string "START OF MOUSE BIOS"
somewhere in the ROM-image.

Mouse Sensitivity
The Mouse Resolution is specified as "50 counts/inch (+/-10%)". There are three
selectable Sensitivity (Threshold) settings:
  0 - slow   - linear fixed level (1:1)
  1 - normal - exponential -?- levels (1:1 to ?:1)  (?:1=smaller than 6:1)
  2 - fast   - exponential six levels (1:1 to 6:1)
Setting 0 returns raw mickeys (so one must implement effects like double-speed
threshold by software). Settings 1-2 can be used directly as screen-pixel
offsets. To change the sensitivity (for port n=0 or n=1):
  [4016h]=01h           ;set STB=1
  dummy=[4016h+n]       ;issue CLK pulse while STB=1 <-- increments the value,
  [4016h]=00h           ;set STB=0                       or wraps from 2 to 0
  ;Thereafter, one should read the Sensitivity bits, typically like so:
  [4016h]=01h           ;set STB=1  ;\another STB on/off, for invoking reading
  [4016h]=00h           ;set STB=0  ;/(not sure if this part is required)
  for i=11 to 0, dummy=[4016h+n], next i              ;skip first 12 bits
  for i=1 to 0, sensitivity.bit(i)=[4016h+n], next i  ;read 2 sensitivity bits
  ;Repeat the above procedure until the desired sensitivity value is reached.
Caution: According to Nintendo, the internal threshold factors aren't
initialized until the change-sensitivty procedure is executed at least once
(ie. after power-up, or after sensing a newly connected mouse, one MUST execute
the change-sensitivity procedure, EVEN if the mouse does return the desired
2bit sensitivity code).

Moreover, the "SNES Test Program" (1991 by Nintendo) includes a Mouse test.

SNES Controllers Multiplayer 5 (MP5) (Five Player Adaptor)
----------------------------------------------------------

The MP5 plugs into one Controller Port on the SNES (typically Port 2), and has
4 ports for controllers to be plugged into it (labeled 2 through 5). It also
has an override switch which makes it pass through Pad 2 and ignore everything
else.

Reading Controller Data
  [4016h].Bit0=1                                 ;-strobe on (to player 1-5)
  [4016h].Bit0=0                                 ;-strobe off (to player 1-5)
  read any number of bits from [4016h].Bit0      ;-read Player 1 data
  read any number of bits from [4017h].Bit0/Bit1 ;-read Player 2/3 data
  [4201h].Bit7=0                                 ;-select Player 4/5
  read any number of bits from [4017h].Bit0/Bit1 ;-read Player 4/5 data
  [4201h].Bit7=1  ;(prepare here for next frame) ;-select Player 2/3
  do no further access until next frame (allow [4201h].Bit7=1 to stabilize)
The strobe on/off part, and reading first 16bits for player 1-3 is usually done
via automatic reading (whereas, Player 3 data will obviously show up in "JOY4"
register, not in "JOY3" register). Whilst reading further player 1-3 bits, and
all player 4-5 bits is done via manual reading.
As shown above, player 2-3 should be always read before 4-5, for two reasons:
At least some MP5 devices may respond slowly on 0-to-1 transitions of
[4201h].Bit7 (unless the device contains a pull-up resistor). Some MP5's
(namely the Tribal Tap) are always passing CLK to player 2 (in that case player
2 data would be shifted-out when accessing player 4-5 data).

Detecting the MP5 Hardware
Below can be used to detect MP5 in ports 1 (n=0) and 2 (n=1). Games do usually
check both ports (and show an error messages when sensing a MP5 in port 1).
  [4016h].Bit0=1                              ;-strobe on (force MP5 Bit1=1)
  read 8 bits from [4016h+n].Bit1 to byte A   ;-read byte A
  [4016h].Bit0=0                              ;-strobe off (normal data mode)
  read 8 bits from [4016h+n].Bit1 to byte B   ;-read byte B
  if A=FFh and B<>FFh then MP5=present        ;-verify result
If there's no MP5 connected, then A and B will be typically 00h (since most
controllers don't use [4017h].Bit1, exceptions are Turbo File, SFC Modem,
Voice-Kun, and X-Band Keyboard).
If a MP5 is connected, then A will be FFh, and B will be first 8bit of data
from joypad 3 or 5 (which can't be FFh since one can't press all DPAD buttons
at once).

Also note that there is nothing preventing the MP5 from functioning perfectly
when plugged in to Port 1, except that the game must use bit 6 of $4201 instead
of bit 7 to set IOBit and must use the Port 1 registers instead of the Port 2
registers. With 2 MP5 units, one could actually create an 8-player game.

The schematic was released by Nintendo (included in book2.pdf), components are:
  74HCT4053
  74HC126
  74HC241
  4-channel 2-position switch (2P/5P-mode selection)
  LED (glows in 2P-mode)
  1 female joypad connector, 4 male joypad connectors
  plus some resistors
Connection of the four "???" pins is unclear (maybe just wired to VCC or GND).
Unknown if any of the existing adaptors do actually use the above schematic.

Tribal Tap (Naki)
This adaptor is supposed to support up to 6 players (one more than the normal
multitaps). The 6-player feature isn't supported by any games, and it's unknown
how to access the 6th port by software - some people do believe that it isn't
possible at all, and the the 6th port is just a fake - but, that theory is
based on the (incorrect) assumption that PALs cannot be programmed to act as
flipflops. However, if the schematic shown below is correct (the "IN0'E" signal
from Port6 being really <input> to the OUT0 <output> pin; not verified), then
it's probably really a fake.
The Tribal Tap schematic should be reportedly looking somehow like so:

     Note: The PCB has wires to all 7 pins of PORT2,
     but the installed connector has only 5 pins, so,
     in practice, IN1'A and IO'A are not connected.

SNES Controllers Multiplayer 5 - Unsupported Hardware
-----------------------------------------------------

The Multiplayer 5 is incompatible with almost everything except normal
joypads/joysticks. The only other things that do work are Twin Taps, and maybe
also the NTT Data Pad (unless it exceeds 17mA, and unless games do refuse it as
device with "unknown" controller ID).

Unsupported Hardware in MP5 controller slots (due to missing signals)
  Lightguns
  Turbo File
  SFC Modem
  Voice-Kun
  X-Band Keyboard
  A second MP5 plugged into the first MP5

Prohibited Hardware
The hardware/combinations listed below are "prohibited" (and aren't supported
by any offical/licensed games). Nethertheless, they should be working in
practice, hopefully without immediately catching fire or blowing the fuse (but
might act unstable or cause some overheating in some situations; results
<might> vary depending on hardware/production variants, room temperature, used
CPU/PPU/APU load, individual or official safety measures, and on type/amount of
connected cartridges/controllers).

Prohibited Hardware in MP5 controller slots (due to exceeding 17mA per slot)
  Mouse (requires 50mA)
  Devices with unknown controller IDs (which might exceed 17mA)
  Maybe also various unlicensed wireless/autofire joypads/joysticks

Prohibited Hardware in CARTRIDGE slot (due to overall power consumption)
  Cartridges with GSU-n (programmable RISC CPU) (aka Super FX/Mario Chip)
  Maybe also things like X-Band modem and Cheat Devices

Prohibited Hardware in BOTH controller ports (unspecified reason)
  Two MP5's (connected to port 1 and 2) (maybe also power consumption related)

Prohibited Hardware in FIRST controller port (just by convention)
  MP5 in port 1 (instead of port 2) (would mess-up the port 2-5 numbering)

Super Scope Bits
  1st          Fire Button   (0=High=Released, 1=Low=Pressed/Newly Pressed)
  2nd          Cursor Button (0=High=Released, 1=Low=Pressed)
  3rd          Turbo Switch  (0=Normal/PowerOn, 1=Turbo/PowerOn)
  4th          Pause Button  (0=High=Released, 1=Low=Newly Pressed)
  5th..6th     Extra ID Bits (always 0=High)
  7th          Offscreen     (0=High=Okay, 1=Low=CRT-Transmission Error)
  8th          Noise         (0=High=Okay, 1=Low=IR-Transmission Error)
  9th..12th    Extra ID Bits (always 1=Low)
  13th..16th   ID Bits       (always 1=Low)
  17th and up  Unused        (always 1=Low)

'f' is Fire, 'c' is Cursor, 't' is Turbo, 'p' is Pause, 'o' is Offscreen, and
'n' is Noise.

For obtaining the H/V position& latch flag (Ports 213Ch,213Dh,213Fh), see:
--> SNES PPU Timers and Status

The SuperScope has two modes of operation: normal mode and turbo mode. The
current mode is controlled by a switch on the unit, and is indicated by the 't'
bit. Note however that the 't' bit is only updated when the Fire button is
pressed (i.e. the 'f' bit is set). Thus, when you turn turbo on the 't' bit
remains clear until you shoot, and similarly when turbo is deactivated the bit
remains set until you fire.

In either mode, the Pause bit will be set for the first strobe after the pause
button is pressed, and then will be clear for subsequent strobes until the
button is pressed again. However, the pause button is ignored if either cursor
or fire are down(?).

In either mode, the Cursor bit will be set while the Cursor button is pressed.

In normal mode, the Fire bit operates like Pause: it is on for only one strobe.
In turbo mode, it remains set as long as the button is held down.

When Fire/Cursor are set, Offscreen will be set if the gun did not latch during
the previous strobe and cleared otherwise (Offscreen is not altered when
Fire/Cursor are both clear).

If the Fire button is being held when turbo mode is activated, the gun sets the
Fire bit and begins latching. If the Fire button is being held when turbo mode
is deactivated, the next poll will have Fire clear but the Turbo bit will not
be updated until the next fire (i.e. FcTp => turbo off => fcTp, not fctp).

The PPU latch operates as follows: When Fire or Cursor is set, IOBit is set to
0 when the gun sees the TV's electron gun, and left a 1 otherwise. Thus, if the
SNES also leaves it one (bit 7 of $4201), the PPU Counters will be latched at
that point. This would also imply that bit 7 of $4213 will be 0 at the moment
the SuperScope sees the electron gun.

Since the gun depends on the latching behavior of IOBit, it will only function
properly when plugged into Port 2. If plugged into Port 1 instead, everything
will work except that there will be no way to tell where on the screen the gun
is pointing.

When creating graphics for the SuperScope, note that the color red is not
detected. For best results, use colors with the blue component over 75% and/or
the green component over 50%.

Data2 is presumably not connected, but this is not known for sure.

Sega Version
There's also an identically looking Blue Gun for Sega (but with 9pin joystick
connector). The Pink Gun can be used with both SNES and Sega Blue Gun versions.

The Justifier returns 48 bits of data out Data1. Presumably it returns one bits
after (if so, it really only returns 32 bits), but this is not known. The data
is:
  0000000000001110 01010101TtSsl000 1111111111111111

T/t are the trigger states for guns 1 and 2. S/s are the start button states
for guns 1 and 2. 'l' indicates which gun was connected to IOBit: 1 means gun
1, 0 means gun 2. Note that 'l' toggles even when gun 2 is not connected.

IOBit is used just like for the SuperScope. However, since two guns may be
plugged into one port, which gun is actually connected to IOBit changes each
time Latch cycles. Also note, the Justifier does not wait for the trigger to be
pulled before attempting to latch, it will latch every time it sees the
electron gun. Bit 6 of $213F may be used to determine if the Justifier was
pointed at the screen or not.

Data2 is presumably not connected, but this is not known for sure.

For obtaining the H/V position& latch flag (Ports 213Ch,213Dh,213Fh), see:
--> SNES PPU Timers and Status

Nardz: "Actually when I was a kid, I bought the SNES Justifier Battle Clash
package. The Weird thing about it is that The package had A Sega Justifier in
it, but it came with this SNES/Sega Adapter, which pluged into your SNES and
the Sega Justifier would plug into the back of the connector." -- But, Battle
Clash is a Super Scope game, not a Justifier game???

The pinouts of the 6pin RJ12-socket are unknown.

SNES Controllers M.A.C.S. (Lightgun)
------------------------------------

Multi-Purpose Arcade Combat Simulator (M.A.C.S.)
This lightgun was used by the US Army to introduce beginners how to kill real
people. It was also shown on career days at high schools to win new recruits.
The hardware consists of a small lightpen attached to a M16 rifle. Software
cartridges exist for C64 and SNES.

I/O Ports
The lightgun connects to the lightpen input on 2nd controller port. Aside from
the HV-Latches, it uses only one I/O signal:
  4017h.Bit0 Trigger Button (1=LOW=Pressed)
That is, only a single bit (no serial data transfer with CLK/STB signals). A
standard joypad attached to 1st controller port allows to calibrate the
lightpen (via Select button).
For obtaining the H/V position& latch flag (Ports 213Ch,213Dh,213Fh), see:
--> SNES PPU Timers and Status

SNES Software
  MACS Basic Rifle Marksmanship v1.1e (v1.2a) (1993) Sculptured Software (US)
  MACS Basic Rifle Marksmanship v1994.0 (1994?)
  MACS Moving Target Simulator (?)
Note: Version "1.1e" is displayed in the title screen, whilst the version
string at ROM offset 05819h identifies it as version "1.2a". The program code
looks crude and amateurish, and (as indicated by the corrupted ROM header) it
never passed through Nintendo's Seal of Quality process.

SNES Controllers Twin Tap
-------------------------

The Twin Tap from Partyroom21 (aka Yonezawa PR21) is a special controller for
8-player quiz games. The Twin Tap itself consists of 7pin SNES controller
connector with two cables, and a push-button on each cable-end (one button per
player). For the 8-player mode, four Twin Taps need to be connected to a
multiplayer adaptor (such like Partyroom21's own "Multi Adaptor Auto").

The Twin Tap is supported by
  Shijou Saikyou no Quiz Ou Ketteisen Super (1992) TBS/Partyroom21/S'pal (JP)

Transfer Protocol
  1st         Seems to be 2nd Button (1=Low=Pressed) (would be "B" on joypads)
  2nd         Seems to be 1st Button (1=Low=Pressed) (would be "Y" on joypads)
  3rd..12th   Unknown
  13th..16th  Unknown (would be ID Bit3..0 on other SNES controllers)
  17th..24th  Unknown (would be Extended ID Bit7..0 on other SNES controllers)
  25th and up Unknown
Judging from disassembled game code, the 4bit ID might be 00h or 0Eh, in the
latter case, there <should> be also a unique Extended ID value.

Write Direction (invoked by LONG Strobe signal, data output on STROBE line)

Observe that read/write direction depends on length of initial Strobe signal
(so games that are reading joypad with other strobe-lengths might mess up
things).
10th bit and up (including the 4bit Controller ID) might be garbage (depending
on how the 8051 CPU in the keyboard handles the data transfer). However, with
appropriate timings, detecting a Miracle could be done via the "Firmware
version request" MIDI command.
Note: The SNES Miracle software expects the piano keyboard connected to Port 1,
and a normal joypad connected to Port 2.

transferred through MIDI or RS232 or NES/SNES/Genesis controller cables). Below
lists the supported MIDI messages (including "Undocumented" messages, which are
used by the Miracle's SNES software, although they aren't mentioned in the
Miracle's Owner's Manual).

Data from piano is always sent on first channel (#=0). Sending data to piano
can be done on first 8 channels (#=0..7), different instruments can be assigned
to each channel. Although undocumented, the SNES software does initialize 16
channels (#=0..0Fh), unknown if the hardware does support/ignore those extra
channels.

Notes:
 ' These programs are single voice, which lets The Miracle play up to 16
   notes simultaneously. All other programs are dual voice, which lets it
   play up to 8 notes simultaneously.
 * 072..076 See below for a list of Effects/Percussion sounds.
 # 078..080 To be true to the nature of the sampled instrument, these patches
   do not respond to velocity.

SNES Controllers X-Band Keyboard
--------------------------------

The X-Band keyboard is a (rare) optional add-on for the X-Band Modem, intended
to allow faster chatting/mailing as with the joypad controlled on-screen
keyboard.

Keyboard Layout
The keyboard has a black case, 84 keys, an X-Band logo in upper left, and
connection cable (to SNES controller port) attached in upper-right. Judging
from the only existing photo, there is no LED, and the keys are arranged like
so:

Normal Controller Access (via STB and DATA0)
  1st-12th    Unknown/unused
  13th-16th   Unknown/unused (should be usually a 4bit ID)
  17th-24th   Unknown/unused (should be sometimes extended 8bit ID)
  25th and up Unknown/unused
Note: If the keyboard data is transferred in sync with STB, then "17th and up"
are the LSBs of the 2bit keyboard data pairs (though it might also be in sync
with falling IOBIT, rather than with STB).

Keyboard Access (read_scancodes) (via IOBIT and DATA0 & DATA1)
Below might be required to be preceeded by reading normal 16bit controller data
(eg. via auto-joypad-reading) (ie. unknown if below needs leading STB signal,
and preceeding 16xCLK signals).
  [004201]=7Fh                 ;-set IOBIT=0
  id=getbits(8)                ;-read ID byte (must be 78h, aka "x")
  if CAPS=OFF [004201]=FFh     ;-set IOBIT=1 (when CAPS=OFF) (CAPS LED?)
  num=getbits(4)               ;-read num scancodes
  if num>0 then for i=1 to num ;\
    [dst]=getbits(8)           ; read that scancodes (if any)
    dst=dst+1                  ;
  next i                       ;/
  [004201]=FFh  ;set IOBIT=1   ;-set IOBIT=1
Note: When reading the ID bits, BIOS sets IOBIT=1 after reading the first 2bit
group (purpose unknown). When reading ONLY the ID (without reading following
scancodes), then the scancodes do remain in the keyboard queue.

getbits(n)
  for i=1 to n/2                       ;\

Notes
The Numeric-Keypad (NUM) isn't present on the existing X-Band keyboard. There
is probably only one of the two backslash keys (5Ch/5Dh) and only one of the
two Button-A keys (86h/E0h,5Ah) implemented. The existing keyboard doesn't seem
to have a CAPS LED (nor any other LEDs).
There are several "unused" keys (which aren't used by the BIOS), unknown
if/which scancodes are assigned to them.
Unknown if the japanese BIOS includes support for japanese symbols, and unknown
if there was a keyboard released in japan. (Note: With an emulated US keyboard,
the Japanese BIOS does realize cursor/enter keys, it does also store typed
ASCII characters in a ring-buffer at [3BB6+x]; but, for whatever reason, does
then ignore those characters).

SNES Controllers Tilt/Motion Sensors
------------------------------------

There are a few SNES controllers with Tilt/Motion Sensors, most or all of them
are emulating normal SNES joypad button/direction signals, which is making them
compatible with existing games, but also means that the SNES receives only
digital data (pressed/released) rather than anlogue (slow/fast) data.
Alltogether, the controllers appear to be more uncomfortable than useful.

BatterUP (1994) (Sports Sciences Inc.)
The BatterUP is a 24-inch foam-covered plastic baseball bat for Sega Genesis
and Super Nintendo. Reportedly, it "doesn't sense swing speed or location, only
timing" (whatever that means, probably simulating a button-pressed signal at
the time when swinging the bat). Aside from the swing/motion sensor, the middle
of the bat contains joypad buttons.

TeeV Golf (1993/1995) (Sports Sciences Inc.)
The TeeV Golf hardware consists of a wireless (battery-powered) golf club, and
a rectangular box which is supposed to be set on the floor. There's a mimmicked
(half) golf ball in the middle of the box. According to photos, there are two
rows of six "red dots" on the box (these might be nonfunctional decorative
elements, or important LEDs/sensors for motion tracking?), some kind of a BIOS
cartridge or so (which seems to contain something customized for specific
games), and two connection cables (one to the consoles controller port, and one
forwarded to a joypad).

According to the box: The TeeV SNES version is compatible with PGA Tour Golf
(unknown if that refers to the whole PGA series, and unknown if there are other
games supported; other games might possibly require other "BIOS" cartridges).
The PGA Tour Golf BIOS cartridge does probably translate motion data to a
specially timed sequence of joypad button pressed/released signals.
There are TeeV versions for SNES, Sega Genesis, and PC. The US Patent number
for the TeeV hardware is 4971325 (with the addition of "other patents
pending").

StuntMaster (VictorMaxx)
Advertised as "3-D Virtual Reality Headset".
"Despite what the box says, the StuntMaster VR is not a 3D display. It contains
one extremely grainy low resolution LCD screen in the center of the goggles. If
you put it on, it hurts your face. The display singes your retinas with an
intensely fuzzy, hard-to-focus-on image. The head tracking mechanism is nothing
more than a stick you clip to your shoulder (see picture above) which slides
through a loop on the side of the headset. When you turn your head, the
StuntMaster detects the stick sliding in the loop and translates this into a
left or right button press on a control pad, assuming you've actually hooked it
up to the controller port of your SNES or Genesis. Remember the "point-of-view
instantly scrolls or rotates with the turn of your head" quote? I'd love to see
that happen in Super Mario World. Obviously, it couldn't actually work unless
the game were programmed for that functionality in advance. Unless, of course,
you're playing Doom and you want to turn left or right by moving your head."

Nordic Quest (interactive ski-exerciser) (Nordic Track)
The Nordic Quest is an add-on for treadmills (walking-exercising machines) from
Nordic Track. Unlike normal treadmills, the Nordic Track one features two
handles attached to a string, which the user pulls back and forth during
exercising (similar to nordic walking/skiing sticks).
The Nordic Quest includes replacement handles with DPAD (left handle) and
buttons (right handle), allowing to play "virtually any" joypad controlled
games during exercising; there aren't any special "nordic" games for the
controller, instead it can be used for games like golf, car-racing, and flight
simulations (as illustrated on the box).
The exercising intensity is claimed to affect the game speed - unknown how this
works - maybe by toggling the DPAD on/off, or maybe by toggling the Start
(pause) button on/off?

JS-306 Power Pad Tilt (Champ) (joypad with autofire, slowmotion, tilt-mode)

The so-called Golf Mat is actually a (not very flat) plastic box, with a
mimmicked (half) golf ball mounted on it, the three black fields (shown as ###
in the ASCII drawing) might contain laser sensors, the front panel has six
buttons: Left/Pause, Right, Up, Down, A/Start and B/Cancel.
For additional/better menu controls, one can connect a normal joypad to SNES
port 1.

Below describes the overall transfer protocol. Unknown if/how/what kind of
motion, speed, and/or direction information is transmitted via that protocol.

Lasabirdie Controller Data (connected to Port 2)
  1st         Button B (CANCEL)    (1=Low=Pressed)
  2nd         Button DOWN          (1=Low=Pressed)

  17th..24th  Extra ID bit7-0 (unknown)  ;read, but not checked by software
  25th and up Unknown/Unused (probably all one, or all zero ?)

Command Bytes
Command bytes are used to select a specific packet, and (during the packet
transfer) to select nibbles within the previously selected packet:
  20h        select "GOLF_READY!" ID string packet
  22h        select version string packet
  30h        select whatever data packet?
  3Fh        select whatever data packet?
  40h..55h   sent while receiving nibbles number 0..21
  5Fh        terminate transfer (or re-select default packet type?)
Bytes are output via Port 4201h at a fixed baudrate of circa 10000 bits/second:
  output 1 start bit ("0")
  output 8 data bits (MSB first)
  output 2 stop bits ("0","0")
  release line (output "1", until the next byte transferred in next frame)
Exact time per bit is 2140 master cycles (10036 bps at 21.47727MHz NTSC clock).

Packets
Packets consist of 11 bytes, transferred in 22 nibbles (of 4bit each). For
whatever reason, the software receives only one nibble per frame, so a complete
packet-transfer takes about 0.36 seconds. The bits are transferred MSB first
(bit3,bit2,bit1,bit0), whilst nibbles are transferred LSB first (bit3-0,
bit7-4). The 11-byte packets can contain following data:
  "GOLF_READY!"                 ;-ID-string packet  ;\without checksum
  FFh,FFh,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0     ;-Empty packet      ;/
  9 chars, 1 unknown, 1 chksum  ;-Version-string    ;\with checksum
  10 data bytes, 1 chksum       ;-Normal packet     ;/
The checksum (if it is present) is calculated by summing up all 10 data bytes,
and adding MSB+LSB of the resulting 16bit sum (ie. sum=sum+sum/100h). The
version string packet contains 9 characters (unknown content), one unused byte
(unknown value), and the checksum byte. Other packet(s) contain whatever
controller/motion data (unknown content).
Below is the procedure for receiving a packet (before doing that, one should
first select a packet, eg. send_byte(20h) for receiving the ID string).
  if [421Ah].bit8 = 0 then exit       ;-exit if no packet available
  for i=0 to 21
    old_state = [421Ah].bit9
   @@wait_lop:

SNES Controllers Exertainment (bicycle exercising machine)
----------------------------------------------------------

The Exertainment is an exercising machine made by Life Fitness. It consists of
a stationary bicycle, a monitor with TV tuner, a SNES game cartridge, and a
SNES console with some extra hardware plugged into its Expansion Port.
The Expansion Port unit contains unknown components, and does seem to have two
6-pin RJ-connectors with unknown purpose (and, of course, the 28pin expansion
connector).

Technical Info
--> SNES Controllers Exertainment - I/O Ports
--> SNES Controllers Exertainment - Data Packets

Supported Games
  Exertainment Mountain Bike Rally (1994) LifeFitness/RadicalEntertainment (US)
  Exertainment Mountain Bike Rally & Speed Racer (combo cart) (prototype) (EU)
Playing normal SNES games during exercising isn't supported (the SNES cartridge
slot isn't externally accessible, and, selecting the pedal resistance requires
special program code in the game cartridge).
The Mountain Bike game works with/without the Exertainment hardware (with the
Exertainment features being shown only if the hardware is present).

Joypad Controls
Joypad like controls are attached to the handlebars, featuring the same 12bit
button/direction signals as normal joypads. In fact, there should be two such
joypads, both mapped as "player 1" input (ie. both wired to Port 4218h).
Turning the handlebars isn't possible, instead, steering is done via DPAD
Left/Right buttons. Whereas, for the Mountain Bike game, steering is needed
only for gaining optional bonus points.

Other Controls
Pedaling speed/force info is probably sent via Port 21C0h Data Packets. The
front panel has six buttons - unknown if the buttons states are sent to the
SNES - Volume & Program Up/Down and Picture-in-picture are possibly wired
directly to the TV set unit, the Menu button is possibly wired to SNES Reset
signal(?)

21C0h (R/W) data packet data (R/W)
  0-7 Data byte
Used to send/receive Data Packets and ACK-bytes (see below).

21C5h (R) data packet recv status  (bit0=?, bit7-1=?=72h?)
  0   Data Available (0=None, 1=Yes, data byte can be read from 21C0h)
  1-7 Stat? (72h=Okay: ACK may be received, other=Bad: Bytes should be flushed)

Packet Format
  From Bike: 15 bytes (command byte, 13 data bytes, checksum byte)
  From SNES: 12 bytes (command byte, 10 data bytes, checksum byte)
Checksum must be 00h minus the command and data bytes. After receiving a packet
with valid checksum, the receiver responds by single ACK-byte (33h). The
overall communication is invoked by sending a single 23h-byte.

Login Phase
  SNES sends 23h (invoke communication)
  Bike sends 33h, and Packet 08h (with "LIFEFITNESS" or "LIFEFITNESs" string)
  SNES sends 33h, and Packet 09h (random values)
  Bike sends 33h, and Packet 0Ah (1st some bytes must rely on above random)
  SNES sends 33h, and Packet 0Bh (based on received data from packet 0Ah)
  Bike sends 33h, and Packet 0Ch (fixed values 00,FF,00,0C,0A,63,00,FA,32,C8)
  SNES sends 33h, and Packet 0Dh (with all-zero data bytes)

PPU Status request
  Bike sends 33h, and Packet 09h (with ignored content)
  SNES sends 33h, and Packet 00h (PPU status and "RAD" string)

Further Commands
Once when login is completed, whatever data is exchanged.
One known thing is that SNES sends the Pedal Resistance in upper 4bit of the
command bytes (ie. in the MSB of the first byte of the 12-byte packets)
(command LSBs used are 00h..08h in this case).
There should be also pedal-speed sent from Bike.
The other amounts of data are unknown - might include TV control - and possibly
calories-burned and weight-loss or such things calculated by the CPU in the
expansion port unit?

SNES Add-On Turbo File (external backup memory for storing game positions)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

The Turbo File add-ons are an external battery-backed RAM-Disks made by ASCII.
Turbo File hardware has been produced for NES, SNES, 8bit Gameboy, and Gameboy
Advance. It's been sold only in japan, and it's mainly supported by ASCII's own
games. The SNES related hardware versions are:
  SNES Turbo File Twin (160K) (128K in STF mode, 4x8K in TFII mode)
  SNES Turbo File Adapter (SNES adapter for NES Turbo File & Turbo File II)

TFII Mode (old NES mode, 4x8Kbyte)

--> SNES Add-On Turbo File - STF Mode Filesystem

Compatible Games
--> SNES Add-On Turbo File - Games

NES Turbofile (AS-TF02)
Original NES version, contains 8Kbytes battery backed RAM, and a 2-position
PROTECT switch, plus a LED (unknown purpose).

NES Turbo File II (TFII)
Newer NES version, same as above, but contains 32Kbytes RAM, divided into four
8Kbyte slots, which can be selected with a 4-position SELECT switch.

SNES Turbo File Adapter
Allows to connect a Turbo File or Turbo File II to SNES consoles. Aside from
the pin conversion (15pin NES to 7pin SNES), it does additionally contain some
electronics (for generating a SNES controller ID, and a more complicated
protocol for entering the data-transfer phase). Aside from storing SNES game
positions, this can be also used to import NES files to SNES games.

SNES Turbo File Twin
SNES version with 160Kbyte SRAM, and with 5-position mode SELECT switch. 128K
used in STF mode ("SNES Super Turbo File"), and 4x8K used in TFII modes 1/2/3/4
(equivalent to NES Turbo File II with SNES Turbo File Adapter).

Small square box that connects via cable to controller port.
Two position PROTECT switch (off/on)
Five position SELECT switch (STF, and "TFII" 1,2,3,4)
There is a red LED. And two 1.5V batteries?

---------------------------------------------

Turbo File Memory
The first byte (at offset 0000h) is unused (possibly because that there is a
risk that other games with other controller access functions may destroy it);
after resetting the address, one should read one dummy byte to skip the unused
byte. The used portion is 8191 bytes (offset 0001h..1FFFh). The "filesystem" is
very simple: Each file is attached after the previous file, an invalid file ID
indicates begin of free memory.

Turbo File Fileformat (newer files) (1987 and up)
Normal files are formatted like so:
  2   ID "AB" (41h,42h)
  2   Filesize (16+N+2) (including title and checksum)
  16  Title in ASCII (terminated by 00h or 01h)
  N   Data Portion
  2   Checksum (all N bytes in Data Portion added together)

Turbo File Fileformat (old version) (1986)
The oldest Turbo File game (NES Castle Excellent from 1986) doesn't use the
above format. Instead, it uses the following format, without filename, and with
hardcoded memory offset 0001h..01FFh (511 bytes):
  1   Don't care (should be 00h)    ;fixed, at offset 0001h
  2   ID AAh,55h                    ;fixed, at offset 0002h..0003h
  508 Data Portion (Data, end code "BEDEUTUN", followed by some unused bytes)
CAUTION:
  The early version has transferred all bytes in reversed bit-order,
  so above ID bytes AAh,55h will be seen as 55h,AAh in newer versions!
Since the address is hardcoded, Castle Excellent will forcefully destroy any
other/newer files that are located at the same address. Most newer NES/SNES
games (like NES Fleet Commander from 1988, and SNES Wizardry 5 from 1992) do
include support for handling the Castle Excellent file. One exception that
doesn't support the file is NES Derby Stallion - Zenkoku Ban from 1992.

The FAT is 4096 bytes in size:
  000h..1EFh  Entries for 1st 124Kbytes
  1F0h..3EFh  Entries for 2nd 128Kbytes (if any)
  3F0h..5EFh  Entries for 3rd 128Kbytes (if any)
  5F0h..7EFh  Entries for 4th 128Kbytes (if any) (seems to be bugged)

  FFCh..FFFh  ID "FAT0"
Each FAT Entry is 32bit (4 bytes) wide:
  0-11   filesize in kbyte (1st blk), 000h (2nd..Nth blk), FFFh (free blk)
  12-23  NNNh (next blk), FFFh (last blk), or also FFFh (free blk)
  24-31  8bit sector chksum (all 1024 bytes added together), or FFh (free blk)
Note: The above FFFh values should be as so (though older games are checking
only the upper 4bit, thereby treating any Fxxh values as free/last block).
Unused FAT entries (that exceed memory capacity) are also marked as "free".

The first 24 bytes (in the first sector) of a file contain File ID & Name:
  000h..003h ID1 (must be "SHVC")

  008h..017h Filename (padded with ...spaces ?)
  018h..     File Data (Filesize from FAT, multiplied by 1024, minus 24 bytes)
ID2 and Name may contain ASCII characters 20h..3Fh and 41h..5Ah.

Note: Castlequest (US version of Castle Excellent) reportedly lacks support.

SNES Add-On Barcode Battler (barcode reader)
--------------------------------------------

The Barcode Battler from Epoch allows to scan barcodes (either from special
paper cards, or from daily-life products like food packagings), games can then
use the barcode digits as Health Points, or other game attributes.

Standalone-Mode
The device was originally designed as stand-alone gaming console with some push
buttons, a very simple LCD screen with 7-segment digits & some predefined LCD
symbols, and a built-in game BIOS (ie. without external cartridge slot, and
without any bitmap graphics).

Link-Mode
Later versions (with black case) include an "EXT" link port, allowing to link
to other Barcode Battler hardware, or to Famicom/Super Famicom consoles. The
EXT port is probably bi-directional, but existing Famicom/Super Famicom games
seem to be using it only for reading barcodes (without accessing the LCD
screen, push buttons, speaker, or EEPROM).

Barcode Battler Hardware Versions
  Region__Case___EXT___Barcode-Reader__Name__________________Year___
  Japan   White  None  Yes             Barcode Battler       1991
  Japan   Black  1     Yes             Barcode Battler II    1992
  Japan   Black  2     None            Barcode Battler II^2  199x
  Europe  Black  1     Yes             Barcode Battler       1992/1993
The versions with one EXT socket can be connected to NES/SNES, or to one or
more of the "II^2" units (allowing more players to join the game).

Connection to SNES/NES consoles
Connection to Super Famicom or SNES requires a "BBII INTERFACE": a small box
with 4 LEDs and two cables attached (with 3pin/7pin connectors), the interface
has been sold separetedly, it's needed to add a SNES controller ID code to the
transmission protocol.
Connection to Famicom consoles requires a simple cable (without interface box)
(with 3pin/15pin connectors), the cable was shipped with the "Barcode World"
Famicom cartridge, connection to NES would require to replace the 15pin Famicom
connector by 7pin NES connector.
The required 3pin EXT connector is available only on newer Barcode Battlers
(with black case), not on the original Barcode Battler (with white case).
  Unknown if all 3 pins are actually used by NES/SNES cable/interface?
  Unknown if NES/SNES software can access LCD/buttons/speaker/EEPROM ?

Connectivity
"Connectivity mode is accessible if you plug in a standard 3.5mm mono jack plug
into the expansion port on the left hand side of the unit, hold down the
R-Battle and R-Power buttons and turn the unit on, the Barcode Battler II goes
into scanner mode."

Barcode Battler II Interface
The hardware itself was manufactured by Epoch, and licensed by Nintendo (it
says so on the case).
The four lights, from left to right, indicate as follows:
  "OK"    All is well, the device is operating as normal.
  "ER"    Maybe there's something wrong?
  "BBII"  The Barcode Battler is sending data to the device.
  "SFC"   The SFC/SNES is waiting for a signal from the Barcode Battler.

Component List (may be incomplete)
  80pin NEC uPD75316GF (4bit CPU with on-chip 8Kx8 ROM, 512x4 RAM, LCD driver)
  8pin Seiko S2929A (Serial EEPROM, 128x16 = 2Kbit) (same/similar as S29290)
  3pin EXT socket (3.5mm "stereo" jack) (only in new versions with black case)
  LCD Screen (with 7-segment digits and some predefined words/symbols)
  Five LEDs (labelled "L/R-Battle Side")
  Seven Push Buttons (L/R-POWER, L/R-Battle, Power on/off, Select, Set)
  Speaker with sound on/off switch (both on bottom side)
  Barcode reader (requires card-edges to be pulled through a slot)
  Batteries (four 1.5V AA batteries) (6V)

SNES Add-On Barcode Transmission I/O
------------------------------------

The Barcode Battler outputs barcodes as 20-byte ASCII string, at 1200 Baud,
8N1. The NES software receives that bitstream via Port 4017h.Bit2. The SNES
software requires a BBII Interface, which converts the 8bit ASCII digits into
4bit nibbles, and inserts SNES controller ID and status codes, the interface
should be usually connected to Controller Port 2 (although the existing SNES
games seem to accept it also in Port1).

Barcode Battler (with BBII Interface) SNES Controller Bits
  1st..12th   Unknown/unused (probably always 0=High?)
  13th..16th  ID Bits3..0          (MSB first, 1=Low=Zero) (must be 0Eh)
  17th..24th  Extended ID Bits7..0 (MSB first, 1=Low=Zero) (must be 04h)
  25th        Status: Barcode present (1=Low=Yes)
  26th        Status: Error Flag 1 ?
  27th        Status: Error Flag 2 ?
  28th        Status: Unknown      ?
Following bits need/should be read ONLY if the "Barcode Present" bit is set.
  29th-32th   1st Barcode Digit, Bits3..0  (MSB first, 1=Low=Zero)
  33th-36th   2nd Barcode Digit, Bits3..0  (MSB first, 1=Low=Zero)
  37th-40th   3rd Barcode Digit, Bits3..0  (MSB first, 1=Low=Zero)
  41th-44th   4th Barcode Digit, Bits3..0  (MSB first, 1=Low=Zero)
  45th-48th   5th Barcode Digit, Bits3..0  (MSB first, 1=Low=Zero)
  49th-52th   6th Barcode Digit, Bits3..0  (MSB first, 1=Low=Zero)
  53th-56th   7th Barcode Digit, Bits3..0  (MSB first, 1=Low=Zero)
  57th-60th   8th Barcode Digit, Bits3..0  (MSB first, 1=Low=Zero)
  61th-64th   9th Barcode Digit, Bits3..0  (MSB first, 1=Low=Zero)
  65th-68th   10th Barcode Digit, Bits3..0 (MSB first, 1=Low=Zero)
  69th-72th   11th Barcode Digit, Bits3..0 (MSB first, 1=Low=Zero)
  73th-76th   12th Barcode Digit, Bits3..0 (MSB first, 1=Low=Zero)
  77th-80th   13th Barcode Digit, Bits3..0 (MSB first, 1=Low=Zero)
  81th and up Unknown/unused
        Above would be 13-digit EAN-13 codes
        Unknown how 12-digit UPC codes are transferred   ;\whatever leading
        Unknown how 8-digit EAN-8 codes are transferred  ;/or ending padding?
For some reason, delays should be inserted after each 8 bits (starting with
24th bit, ie. after 24th, 32th, 40th, 48th, 56th, 64th, 72th bit, and maybe
also after 80th bit). Unknown if delays are also needed after 8th and 16th bit
(automatic joypad reading does probably imply suitable delays, but errors might
occur when reading the ID bits via faster manual reading).

Barcode Battler RAW Data Output
Data is send as 20-byte ASCII string. Bytes are transferred at 1200 Bauds:
  1 Start bit (must be LOW)
  8 Data bits (LSB first, LOW=Zero, HIGH=One)
  1 Stop bit  (must be HIGH)
The first 13 bytes can contain following strings:
  "nnnnnnnnnnnnn"    ;13-digit EAN-13 code (ASCII chars 30h..39h)
  <Unknown>          ;12-digit UPC code (with ending/leading padding?)
  <Unknown>          ;8-digit EAN-8 code (with ending/leading padding?)
  "ERROR        "    ;indicates whatever error (maybe optical scan error?)
The last 7 bytes must contain following ID strings:
  "SUNSOFT"          ;\NES software accepts either one
  "EPOCH",0Dh,0Ah    ;/(unknown which one(s) is send by existing hardware)
There are rumours that one "must" use a mono 3.5mm plug in order to receive
data - that's obviously bullshit, but it might indicate that the middle pin of
stereo plugs must be GNDed in order to switch the Barcode Battler into transmit
mode(?)

SNES Add-On SFC Modem (for JRA PAT)
-----------------------------------

--> SNES Add-On SFC Modem - Data I/O
--> SNES Add-On SFC Modem - Misc

Controller
The SFC Modem is bundled with a special controller (to be connected to
controller port 1) (required for the JRA PAT software):
--> SNES Controllers NTT Data Pad (joypad with numeric keypad)

FLASH Backup
The JRA PAT Modem BIOS cartridges contain FLASH backup memory (unlike other
SNES cartridges which do use battery-backed SRAM instead of FLASH).
--> SNES Cart FLASH Backup

Baudrates
The BIOS seems to support max 2400 baud (old BIOS version) and 9600 baud (new
BIOS version) - accordingly, there are probably also two different hardware
versions of the SFC Modem.

Note
There's also another modem (which connects to cartridge slot):
--> SNES Cart X-Band (2400 baud Modem)

SNES Add-On SFC Modem - Data I/O
--------------------------------

The modem is intended to be connected to controller port 2. RX Data, TX Data,
and Modem Status are simultaneously transferred via three I/O lines. The
overall transfer length (with ID bits) is 16-bit, however, after checking the
ID bits, one can abbreviate the transfer to 9-bit length.

SNES Add-On SFC Modem - Misc
----------------------------

"The Modem as far as I know only had one function and that was to allow you to
do online betting via the official JRA (Japanese Horse Racing) online service.
The modem ran on the NTT lines which probably means that NTT (Nippon
Telecommunications) also had something to make out of this service or at least
they thought they did :-D"
  JRA = Japan Racing Association (japanese horse racing)
  PAT = Personal Access Terminal (for telephone/online betting)
  NTT = Nippon Telegraph and Telephone (japanese telecommunications)

NTT JRA PAT (1997) (2400 Baud version) (J)
  baud rates seem to be 2400,1200 (see ROM 03:8910) (and "AT%B" strings)
  uses standard AT-commands (ATI0, ATS0?, ATD, ATX1, etc.)
  supports AMD FLASH only
  there are two ROM versions (SHVC-TJAJ-0 and SHVC-TJBJ-0)

NTT JRA PAT - Wide Baken Taiyou (1999) (9600 Baud version) (J)
  baud rates seem to be 9600,2400,1200 (see ROM 03:87F0) (and "AT%B" strings)
  uses standard AT-commands (ATI0, ATS0?, ATD, ATX1, etc.)
  supports AMD/ATMEL/SHARP FLASH
  there are two ROM versions (SHVC-TJDJ-0 and SHVC-TJEJ-0)

Zaitaku Touhyou System - SPAT4-Wide (1999 or so)
  unknown, reportedly also horse betting with NTT modem
  there is one ROM version (SHVC-TOBJ-0)

There is no special "modem-hardware" entry in cartridge header, but: note that
all NTT/SFC modem BIOS have special "SHVC-Txxx-x" game codes.

SNES Add-On Voice-Kun (IR-transmitter/receiver for use with CD Players)
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

The Voice-Kun (sometimes called Voicer-Kun) from Koei is an Infrared
transmitter/receiver. The transmitter part is used for controlling Audio CD
Players (ie. to select and play tracks from Audio CDs that are included with
supported games). The receiver part is used to "learn" IR-signals from
different Remote Control manufacturers.

Controller Bits
The IR-unit should be connected to Port 2. The controller ID can be read via
4017h.Bit0 (serially, with STB/CLK signals). The actual IR-data is transferred
via 4017h.Bit1/4201h.Bit7 (directly, without STB/CLK signals).
 4017h.Bit0:
  1st-12th    Unknown/unused (probably always 0=High?)
  13th-16th   ID Bits 3-0 (MSB First, 0=High=Zero) (always 0Dh)
  17th and up Unknown/unused (probably always whatever?)
 4017h.Bit1:
  any bits    Infrared level (receiver) (0=High=Off, 1=Low=On)
 4201h.Bit7:
  any bits    Infrared level (transmit) (0=Low=Off, 1=High=On)

Voice-Kun Games
  Angelique Voice Fantasy (29 Mar 1996)
  EMIT Vol. 1 - Toki no Maigo (25 Mar 1995)
  EMIT Vol. 2 - Inochigake no Tabi (25 Mar 1995)
  EMIT Vol. 3 - Watashi ni Sayonara wo (25 Mar 1995)
  EMIT Value Set (EMIT Vol. 1-3) (15 Dec 1995)

Note - Soundware
Koei also made a number of "Soundware" games (for other consoles/computers),
which did also include Audio CDs or Audio Tapes.
For the SNES, Koei did release "Super Sangokushi II", originally on 15/09/1991,
and re-released on 30 Mar 1995, at least one of that two releases (unclear
which one) has been reportedly available with "Soundware" - unknown if that
soundware version is Voice-Kun compatible, or (if it isn't compatible) unknown
how else it was intended to be used...?)

SNES Cartridge ROM Header
-------------------------

The Cartridge header is mapped to 00FFxxh in SNES memory (near the exception
vectors). In ROM-images it is found at offset 007Fxxh (LoROM), 00FFxxh (HiROM),
or 40FFxxh (ExHiROM); add +200h to that offsets if "(imagesize AND 3FFh)=200h",
ie. if there's an extra header from SWC/UFO/etc. copiers.

Cartridge Header (Area FFC0h..FFCFh)
  FFC0h  Cartridge title (21 bytes, uppercase ascii, padded with spaces)
  FFC0h  First byte of title (or 5Ch far-jump-opcode in Pirate X-in-1 Carts)
  FFD4h  Last byte of title (or 00h indicating Early Extended Header)
  FFD5h  Rom Makeup / ROM Speed and Map Mode (see below)
  FFD6h  Chipset (ROM/RAM information on cart) (see below)
  FFD7h  ROM size (1 SHL n) Kbytes (usually 8=256KByte .. 0Ch=4MByte)
          Values are rounded-up for carts with 10,12,20,24 Mbits
  FFD8h  RAM size (1 SHL n) Kbytes (usually 1=2Kbyte .. 5=32Kbyte) (0=None)
  FFD9h  Country (also implies PAL/NTSC) (see below)
  FFDAh  Developer ID code  (00h=None/Homebrew, 01h=Nintendo, etc.) (33h=New)
  FFDBh  ROM Version number (00h=First)
  FFDCh  Checksum complement (same as below, XORed with FFFFh)
  FFDEh  Checksum (all bytes in ROM added together; assume [FFDC-F]=FF,FF,0,0)

Extended Header (Area FFB0h..FFBFh) (newer carts only)
Early Extended Header (1993) (when [FFD4h]=00h; Last byte of Title=00h):
  FFB0h  Reserved   (15 zero bytes)
Later Extended Header (1994) (when [FFDAh]=33h; Old Maker Code=33h):
  FFB0h  Maker Code (2-letter ASCII, eg. "01"=Nintendo)
  FFB2h  Game Code  (4-letter ASCII) (or old 2-letter padded with 20h,20h)
  FFB6h  Reserved   (6 zero bytes)
  FFBCh  Expansion FLASH Size (1 SHL n) Kbytes (used in JRA PAT)
  FFBDh  Expansion RAM Size (1 SHL n) Kbytes (in GSUn games) (without battery?)
  FFBEh  Special Version      (usually zero) (eg. promotional version)
Both Early and Later Extended Headers:
  FFBFh  Chipset Sub-type (usually zero) (used when [FFD6h]=Fxh)
Note: The early-extension is used only with ST010/11 games.
If the first letter of the 4-letter Game Code is "Z", then the cartridge does
have Satellaview-like Data Pack/FLASH cartridge slot (this applies ONLY to
"Zxxx" 4-letter codes, not to old "Zx  " space padded 2-letter codes).

Cartridge Header Variants
The BS-X Satellaview FLASH Card Files, and Sufami Turbo Mini-Cartridges are
using similar looking (but not fully identical) headers (and usually the same
.SMC file extension) than normal ROM cartridges. Detecting the content of .SMC
files can be done by examining ID Strings (Sufami Turbo), or differently
calculated checksum values (Satellaview). For details, see:
--> SNES Cart Satellaview (satellite receiver & mini flashcard)
--> SNES Cart Sufami Turbo (Mini Cartridge Adaptor)
Homebrew games (and copiers & cheat devices) are usually having several errors
in the cartridge header (usually no checksum, zero-padded title, etc), they
should (hopefully) contain valid entryoints in range 8000h..FFFEh. Many Copiers
are using 8Kbyte ROM bank(s) - in that special case the exception vectors are
located at offset 1Fxxh within the ROM-image.

CPU Exception Vectors (Area FFE0h..FFFFh)
  FFE0h  Zerofilled (or ID "XBOO" for WRAM-Boot compatible files)
  FFE4h  COP vector     (65C816 mode) (COP opcode)
  FFE6h  BRK vector     (65C816 mode) (BRK opcode)
  FFE8h  ABORT vector   (65C816 mode) (not used in SNES)
  FFEAh  NMI vector     (65C816 mode) (SNES V-Blank Interrupt)
  FFECh  ...
  FFEEh  IRQ vector     (65C816 mode) (SNES H/V-Timer or External Interrupt)
  FFF0h  ...
  FFF4h  COP vector     (6502 mode)
  FFF6h  ...
  FFF8h  ABORT vector   (6502 mode) (not used in SNES)
  FFFAh  NMI vector     (6502 mode)
  FFFCh  RESET vector   (6502 mode) (CPU is always in 6502 mode on RESET)
  FFFEh  IRQ/BRK vector (6502 mode)
Note: Exception Vectors are variable in SA-1 and CX4, and fixed in GSU.

Text Fields
The ASCII fields can use chr(20h..7Eh), actually they are JIS (with Yen instead
backslash).

ROM Size / Checksum Notes
The ROM size is specified as "(1 SHL n) Kbytes", however, some cartridges
contain "odd" sizes:
  * Game uses 2-3 ROM chips (eg. one 8MBit plus one 2MBit chip)
  * Game originally designed for 2 ROMs, but later manufactured as 1 ROM (?)
  * Game uses a single 24MBit chip (23C2401)
In all three cases the ROM Size entry in [FFD7h] is rounded-up. In memory, the
"bigger half" is mapped to address 0, followed by the "smaller half", then
followed by mirror(s) of the smaller half. Eg. a 10MBit game would be rounded
to 16MBit, and mapped (and checksummed) as "8Mbit + 4x2Mbit". In practice:
  Title                       Hardware          Size   Checksum
  Dai Kaiju Monogatari 2 (J)  ExHiROM+S-RTC     5MB    4MB + 4 x Last 1MB
  Tales of Phantasia (J)      ExHiROM           6MB    <???>

  Momotaro Dentetsu Happy (J) HiROM+SPC7110     3MB    2 x 3MB
  Sufami Turbo BIOS           LoROM in Minicart xx     without checksum
  Sufami Turbo Games          LoROM in Minicart xx     without checksum
  Dragon Ball Z - Hyper Dimension    LoROM+SA-1 3MB       Overdump 4MB
  SD Gundam GNext (J)                LoROM+SA-1 1.5MB     Overdump 2MB
  Megaman X2                         LoROM+CX4  1.5MB     Overdump 2MB
  BS Super Mahjong Taikai (J)        BS           Overdump/Mirr+Empty
  Demon's Crest... reportedly 12MBit ? but, that's bullshit ?

  SPC7110 Title               ROM Size (Header value)    Checksum
  Super Power League 4        2MB      (rounded to 2MB)  1x(All 2MB)
  Momotaro Dentetsu Happy (J) 3MB      (rounded to 4MB)  2x(All 3MB)
  Far East of Eden Zero (J)   5MB      (rounded to 8MB)  1x(All 5MB)
On-chip ROM contained in external CPUs (DSPn,ST01n,CX4) is NOT counted in the
ROM size entry, and not included in the checksum.

Homebrew files often contain 0000h,0000h or FFFFh,0000h as checksum value.

ROM Speed and Map Mode (FFD5h)
  Bit7-6 Always 0
  Bit5   Always 1 (maybe meant to be MSB of bit4, for "2" and "3" MHz)
  Bit4   Speed (0=Slow, 1=Fast)              (Slow 200ns, Fast 120ns)
  Bit3-0 Map Mode
Map Mode can be:
  0=LoROM/32K Banks             Mode 20 (LoROM)
  1=HiROM/64K Banks             Mode 21 (HiROM)
  2=LoROM/32K Banks + S-DD1     Mode 22 (mappable) "Super MMC"
  3=LoROM/32K Banks + SA-1      Mode 23 (mappable) "Emulates Super MMC"
  5=HiROM/64K Banks             Mode 25 (ExHiROM)
  A=HiROM/64K Banks + SPC7110   Mode 25? (mappable)
Note: ExHiROM is used only by "Dai Kaiju Monogatari 2 (JP)" and "Tales of
Phantasia (JP)".

DIP vs SMD vs Blobs
Most SNES carts are using DIP chips. SMD chips are used only in carts with
coprocessors (except S-RTC, DSP-n, ST01n). Black blobs are found in several
pirate carts (and in Star Fox, which contains Nintendo's Mario Chip 1, so it's
apparently not a pirate cart).

SNES Cartridge ROM-Image Headers and File Extensions
----------------------------------------------------

Below file headers are dated back to back-up units, which allowed to load
ROM-images from 1.44MB floppy disks into RAM, larger images have been split
into "multi files".
Many of these files do have 512-byte headers. The headers don't contain any
useful information. So, if they are present: Just ignore them. Best way to
detect them is: "IF (filesize AND 3FFh)=200h THEN HeaderPresent=True"
(Headerless cartridges are always sized N*1024 bytes, Carts with header are
N*1024+512 bytes).

Most copiers also include a parallel PC port interface, allowing
your PC to control the unit and store images on your hard drive.
Copier's contain DRAM from 1 Megabyte to 16 Megabytes, 8MegaBits to
128MegaBits respectively. This is the reason why they are so expensive.

SNES Cartridge ROM-Image Interleave
-----------------------------------

Some ROM images are "interleaved", meaning that their content is ordered
differently as how it appears in SNES memory. The interleaved format dates back
to old copiers, most modern tools use/prefer normal ROM-images without
interleave, but old interleaved files may still show up here and there.

Interleave used by Game Doctor & UFO Copiers
These copiers use interleave so that the ROM Header is always stored at file
offset 007Fxxh. For HiROM files, interleave is applied as so: store upper 32K
of all 64K banks, followed by lower 32K of all 64K banks (which moves the
header from 00FFxxh to 007Fxxh). For example, with a 320Kbyte ROM, the ten 32K
banks would be ordered as so:
  0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9 - Original
  1,3,5,7,9,0,2,4,6,8 - Interleaved
For LoROM files, there's no interleave applied (since the header is already at
007Fxxh).
Detecting an interleaved file could be done as so:
  Header must be located at file offset 007Fxxh (ie. in LoROM fashion)
  Header must not be a Sufami Turbo header (=title "ADD-ON BASE CASSETE")
  Header must not be a Satellaview header (=different chksum algorithm)
  Header should not contain corrupted entries
  The "Map Mode" byte at "[007FD5h] ANDed with 0Fh" is 01h,05h,0Ah (=HiROM)
If so, the file is interleaved (or, possibly, it's having a corrupted header
with wrong map mode setting).

Interleave used by Human Stupidity
There are interleaving & deinterleaving tools, intended to convert normal
ROM-images to/from the format used by above copiers. Using that tools on files
that are already in the desired format will result in messed-up garbage. For
example, interleaving a 320Kbyte file that was already interleaved:
  1,3,5,7,9,0,2,4,6,8 - Interleaved
  3,7,0,4,8,1,5,9,2,6 - Double-Interleaved
Or, trying to deinterleave a 320Kbyte file that wasn't interleaved:
  0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9 - Original
  5,0,6,1,7,2,8,3,9,4 - Mis-de-interleaved
One can eventually repair such files by doing the opposite (de-)interleaving
action. Or, in worst case, the user may repeat the wrong action, ending up with
a Triple-Interleaved, or Double-mis-de-interleaved file.
Another case of stupidity would be applying interleave to a LoROM file (which
would move the header <away from> 007Fxxh towards the middle of the file, ie.
the opposite of the intended interleaving effect of moving it <to> 007Fxxh).

ExHiROM Files
ExHiROM Files are also having the data ordered differently as in SNES memory.
However, in this special case, the data SHOULD be ordered as so. The ordering
is: Fast HiROM (4Mbytes, banks C0h..FFh), followed by Slow HiROM banks (usually
1-2MByte, banks 40h..4Fh/5Fh) (of which, the header and exception vectors are
in upper 32K of the first Slow HiROM bank, ie. at file offset 40FFxxh). There
are only 2 games using the ExHiROM format:
  Dai Kaiju Monogatari 2 (JP) (5Mbytes) PCB: SHVC-LJ3R-01
  Tales of Phantasia (JP) (6Mbytes)     PCB: SHVC-LJ3M-01
The ExHiROM ordering is somewhat "official" as it was defined in Nintendo's
developer manuals. Concerning software, the ordering does match-up with the
checksum calculation algorithm (8MB chksum across 4MB plus mirror(s) of
remaining 1-2MB). Concerning hardware, the ordering may have been 'required' in
case Nintendo did (or planned to) use "odd" sized 5Mbyte/6Mbyte-chips (they DID
produce cartridges with 3MByte/24Mbit chips).

SNES Cartridge CIC Lockout Chip
-------------------------------

SNES cartridges are required to contain a CIC chip (security chip aka lockout
chip). The CIC is a small 4bit CPU with built-in ROM. An identical CIC is
located in the SNES console. The same 4bit CPU (but with slightly different
code in ROM) were also used in NES consoles/cartridges.
The CIC in the console is acting as "lock", and that in the cartridge is acting
as "key". The two chips are sending random-like bitstreams to each other, if
the data (or transmission timing) doesn't match the expected values, then the
"lock" issues a RESET signal to the console. Thereby rejecting cartridges
without CIC chip (or such with CICs for wrong regions).

4MHz cycles.
Note: The "data_rx_error" looks totally wrong, but it is somewhat done
intentionally, so there might be a purpose (maybe some rounding, in case 6113
and 3193 are off-sync by a half clock cycle, or maybe an improper bugfix in

Wait until "timer=time", whereas "timer" runs at 1MHz (NES) or 1.024MHz (SNES).

opcodes <begin> at "time-1").

instruction seems to be an older version of that in the Sharp SM5K1..SM5K7
datasheets).

SNES Cartridge CIC Notes
------------------------

Program Counter (PC)
The 10bit PC register consists of a 3bit bank (which gets changed only by
call/jmp/ret opcodes), and a 7bit polynomial counter (ie. not a linear
counter). After fetching opcode bytes, PC is "incremented" as so:
  PC = (PC AND 380h) + (PC.Bit0 XOR PC.Bit1)*40h + (PC AND 7Eh)/2
Ie. the lower 7bit will "increment" through 127 different values (and wrap to
00h thereafter). Address 7Fh is unused (unless one issues a JMP 7Fh opcode,
which would cause the CPU to hang on that address).
  Format     <------------- Valid Address Area ---------->      <--Stuck-->
  Linear     00 01 02 03 04 05 06 07 08 09 0A ... 7C 7D 7E  or  7F 7F 7F 7F
  Polynomial 00 40 60 70 78 7C 7E 3F 5F 6F 77 ... 05 02 01  or  7F 7F 7F 7F
To simplify things, programming tools like assemblers/disassemblers may use
"normal" linear addresses (and translate linear/polynomial addressses when
needed - the polynomial addresses are relevant only for encoding bits in
jmp/call opcodes, and for how the data is physically arranged in the chip ROMs
and in ROM-images).

ROM-Images
The existing ROM-images are .txt files, containing "0" and "1" BITS in ASCII
format, arranged as a 64x64 (or 96x64) matrix (as seen in decapped chips).
  Line 1..32   --->   Address X+9Fh..80h            ;\Lines (Y)
  Line 33..64  --->   Address X+1Fh..00h            ;/
  Column  1+(n*W) --> Data Bit(n) of Address 000h+Y ;\  ;\
  Column  2+(n*W) --> Data Bit(n) of Address 020h+Y ;   ; Columns (X)
  Column  3+(n*W) --> Data Bit(n) of Address 040h+Y ;   ;
  Column  4+(n*W) --> Data Bit(n) of Address 060h+Y ;   ; chips with 200h-byte
  Column  5+(n*W) --> Data Bit(n) of Address 100h+Y ;   ; (W=8) (64x64 bits)
  Column  6+(n*W) --> Data Bit(n) of Address 120h+Y ;   ;
  Column  7+(n*W) --> Data Bit(n) of Address 140h+Y ;   ;
  Column  8+(n*W) --> Data Bit(n) of Address 160h+Y ;   ;/
  Column  9+(n*W) --> Data Bit(n) of Address 200h+Y ;
  Column 10+(n*W) --> Data Bit(n) of Address 220h+Y ;  chips with 300h-byte
  Column 11+(n*W) --> Data Bit(n) of Address 240h+Y ;  (W=12) (96x64 bits)
  Column 12+(n*W) --> Data Bit(n) of Address 260h+Y ;/
Cautions: The bits are inverted (0=1, 1=0) in some (not all) dumps. Mind that
the bytes are arranged in non-linear polynomial fashion (see PC register).
Recommended format for binary ROM-images would be to undo the inversion (if
present), and to maintain the polynomial byte-order.
Note: Known decapped/dumped CICs are D411 and 3195A, and... somebody
decapped/dumped a CIC without writing down its part number (probably=6113).

CIC Timings
The NES CICs are driven by a 4.000MHz CIC oscillator (located in the console,
and divided by 4 in the NES CIC). The SNES CICs are driven by the 24.576MHz APU
oscillator (located and divided by 8 in the console's audio circuit, and
further divided by 3 in the SNES CIC).
Ie. internally, the CICs are clocked at 1.000MHz (NES) or 1.024MHz (SNES). All
opcodes are executed within 1 clock cycles, except for the 2-byte long jumps
(opcodes 78h-7Fh) which take 2 clock cycles. The "skip" opcodes are forcing the
follwing opcode to be executed as a "nop" (ie. the skipped opcode still takes 1
clock cycle; or possibly 2 cycles when skipping long jump opcodes, in case the
CPU supports skipping 2-byte opcodes at all).
After Reset gets released, the CICs execute the first opcode after a short
delay (3195A: randomly 1.0 or 1.25 cycles, D413A: constantly 1.33 cycles)
(whereas, portions of that delay may rely on a poorly falling edge of the
incoming Reset signal).

P0.0-P2.2 are 11 external I/O lines (probably all bidirectional, above
directions just indicates how they are normally used). P2.3-P3.3 are 5 internal
bits (which seem to be useable as "RAM"). Pin numbers are for 16pin NES/SNES
DIP chips (Pin numbers on 18pin SNES SMD chips are slightly rearranged).
P4,P5,P6,P7,P8,P9,PA,PB,PC,PD,PF are unknown/unused (maybe 12x4 further bits,
or mirrors of P0..P3).

CIC Stream Seeds
There are different seeds used for different regions. And, confusingly, there
is a NES-CIC clone made Tengen, which uses different seeds than the real CIC
(some of the differences automatically compensated when summing up values, eg.
8+8 gives same 4bit result as 0+0, other differences are manually adjusted by
Tengen's program code).
Many of the reverse-engineered NES seeds found in the internet are based on the
Tengen design (the USA-seeds extracted from the decapped Tengen chip, the
EUR/ASIA/UK-seeds based on sampled Nintendo-CIC data-streams, and then
converted to a Tengen-compatible seed format). To convert them to real CIC
seeds:
  Nintendo[1..F] = Tengen[1..F] - (2,0,0,0,0,0,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2)
There are other (working) variations possible, for example:
  Nintendo[1..F] = Tengen[1..F] - (2,0,0,0,0,A,E,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2)
  (That, for Tengen-USA seeds. The Tengen-style-EUR/ASIA/UK seeds may differ)
Whereas, the random seed in TengenKEY[1] is meant to be "r+2" (so subtracting 2
restores "r").

CIC Stream Logs
There are some stream logs with filename "XXXX-N.b" where XXXX is the chip
name, and N is the random seed, and bytes in the file are as so:
  Byte 000h, bit0-7 = 1st-8th bit on Pin 1 (DTA.OUT on NES)(DTA.OUT/IN on SNES)
  Byte 001h, bit0-7 = 1st-8th bit on Pin 2 (DTA.IN on NES) (DTA.IN/OUT on SNES)
  Byte 002h, bit0-7 = 9th-16th bit on Pin 1
  Byte 003h, bit0-7 = 9th-16th bit on Pin 2
  etc.
Caution: The "N" in the filename is taken as if the seed were transferred in
order Bit 3,2,1,0 (actually it is Bit 3,0,1,2). Ie. file "3195-1.b" would refer
to a NES-EUR-CIC with seed r=4. The signals in the files are sampled at 1MHz
(ie. only each fourth 4MHz cycle).

The 6113 Chip
The 6113 chip was invented in 1987, and it replaced the 3193 chip in
US/Canadian cartridges (while US/Canadian consoles kept using 3193 chips). When
used in cartridges, the 6113 does usually "emulate" a 3193 chip. But, for
whatever reason, it can do more:
  Console  Cartridge  Notes
  3193     3193       Works (the "old" way)        ;\used combinations
  3193     6113       Works (the "new" way)        ;/
  6113     6113       Works (special seed/timing)  ;\
  6113     3193       Doesn't work                 ; not used as far as known
  6113     ??         Might work (??=unknown chip) ;/
When used in consoles, the 6113 uses slightly different timings and seed values
(and does request cartridges with 6113 chips to use the 6113-mode, too, rather
than emulating the 3193).
One guess: Maybe Nintendo originally used different CICs for NTSC regions (like
3193/3194 for USA/Canada/SouthKorea), and later combined them to one region (if
so, all NES consoles in Canada or SouthKorea should contain 3194/6113 chips,
unlike US consoles which have 3193 chips).

3195A Signals (NES, Europe)
The I/O ports are HIGH (for Output "1"), or LOW-Z (for Output "0" or Input).
Raising edges take circa 0.5us, falling edges take circa 3us.
  4MHz Clock Units     ...............................

  Data From Cartridge  ___.'          ''----.......___ ;/
After Power-up, the Cartridge CIC does randomly start with good timing, or with
all signals delayed by 0.25us. In other words, the Cartridge CIC executes the
first opcode 1.0us or 1.25us (four or five 4MHz cycles) after Reset gets
released. However, for some reason, pushing the Reset Button doesn't alter the
timing, the random-decision occurs only on Power-up.

D413A Signals (SNES, Europe)
The D413A signals are looking strange. First, the software switches signals
High for 3us, but the actual signals are 3.33us High. Second, the signals on
one pin are constantly jumping back'n'forth by 1.33us (in relation to the other
pin).

  1.024MHz Clock Units   .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .

  Data From/To Cart    ____________|         '--...___ ;/
The earlier/later effect occurs because the SNES CICs are occassionally
reversing the data-direction of the pins. Ie. in practice, Data from Cartridge
is constantly 1.33us LATER than from Console.
Software-wise, the D411 (and probably D413A) is programmed as if the Cartridge
CIC would start "immediately", but in practice, it starts 1.33us (four 3.072MHz
cycles) after releasing Reset (that offset seems to be constant, unlike as on
the 3195A where it randomly changes between 1.0us and 1.25us).

Memory Map (SNES Side)
  00h-3Fh/80h-BFh:2200h-23FFh  I/O Ports
  00h-3Fh/80h-BFh:3000h-37FFh  I-RAM (2Kbytes, on-chip, 10MHz fast RAM)
  00h-3Fh/80h-BFh:6000h-7FFFh  One mappable 8Kbyte BW-RAM block
  00h-3Fh/80h-BFh:8000h-FFFFh  Four mappable 1MByte LoROM blocks (max 8Mbyte)
  40h-4Fh:0000h-FFFFh          Entire 256Kbyte BW-RAM (mirrors in 44h-4Fh)
  C0h-FFh:0000h-FFFFh          Four mappable 1MByte HiROM blocks (max 8Mbyte)
The SA-1 supports both LoROM and HiROM mappings (eg. LoROM banks 00h-01h mirror
to HiROM bank 40h). Default exception vectors (and cartridge header) are always
in LoROM bank 00h (ie. at ROM offset 7Fxxh).

Memory Map (SA-1 Side)
Same as on SNES Side (of course without access to SNES internal WRAM and I/O
ports), plus following additional areas:
  00h-3Fh/80h-BFh:0000h-07FFh  I-RAM (at both 0000h-07FFh and 3000h-37FFh)
  60h-6Fh:0000h-FFFFh          BW-RAM mapped as 2bit or 4bit pixel buffer
Some other differences to SNES Side are: I/O Ports are different, on SA-1 side,
the mappable BW-RAM area (at 6000h-7FFFh) can be also assigned as 2bit/4bit
pixel buffer (on SNES Side it's always normal 8bit memory).

Misc
65C816 CPU at 10.74MHz
  2Kbytes internal I-RAM (work ram/stack) (optionally battery backed)
  Optional external backup/work BW-RAM up to 2MByte
  Addressable ROM up to 8MByte (64MBits)

The SA-1 CPU can access memory at 10.74MHz rate (or less, if the SNES does
simultaneouly access cartridge memory).
The SNES CPU can access memory at 2.68MHz rate (or 3.5MHz, but that mode may
not be used in combination with the SA-1).

When interrupts are disabled (in CIE/SIE), then it sounds as if the interrupt
flags still do get set?

"BW-RAM cannot be used during character conversion DMA."

IRQ/NMI/Reset vectors can be mapped. Other vectors (BRK/COP etc) are always
taken from ROM (for BOTH CPUs).

Notes
In HV-mode, the timer clock is obviously equivalent to the dotclock (four 21MHz
master cycles per dot). The time clock in linear mode is unknown (probably same
as in HV-mode).
H-counter has 341 dots (one more as in SNES, but without long dots). Unknown if
the short-scanline (in each 2nd NTSC non-interlaced frame) is reproduced (if it
isn't, then one must periodically reset the timer in order to keep it in sync
with the PPU). There is no provision for interlaced video timings.
The meaning of Port 2212h-2215h is totally unknown (according to existing specs
it <sounds> as if they do set the <current> counter value - though alltogether
it'd be more likely that they do contain <compare> values).
Unknown what happens when setting both HEN and VEN (probably IRQ triggers only
if <both> H+V do match, ie. similar as for the normal SNES timers).

SNES Cart SA-1 Memory Control
-----------------------------

2220h SNES CXB - Set Super MMC Bank C - Hirom C0h-CFh / LoRom 00h-1Fh (W)
2221h SNES DXB - Set Super MMC Bank D - Hirom D0h-DFh / LoRom 20h-3Fh (W)
2222h SNES EXB - Set Super MMC Bank E - Hirom E0h-EFh / LoRom 80h-9Fh (W)
2223h SNES FXB - Set Super MMC Bank F - Hirom F0h-FFh / LoRom A0h-BFh (W)
  0-2  Select 1Mbyte ROM-Bank (0..7)
  3-6  Not used (should be 0)
  7    Map 1Mbyte ROM-Bank (0=To HiRom, 1=To LoRom and HiRom)
If LoRom mapping is disabled (bit7=0), then first 2 MByte of ROM are mapped to
00h-3Fh, and next 2 MByte to 80h-BFh. The registers do affect both SNES and
SA-1 mapping.

2224h SNES BMAPS - SNES CPU BW-RAM Mapping to 6000h-7FFFh (W)
  0-4  Select 8Kbyte BW-RAM Block for mapping to 6000h-7FFFh (0..31)
  5-7  Not used (should be 0)
BW-RAM is always mapped to bank 40h-43h (max 256 Kbytes).
This register allows to map an 8Kbyte chunk to offset 6000h-7FFFh in bank 0-3Fh
and 80h-BFh.

2225h SA-1 BMAP - SA-1 CPU BW-RAM Mapping to 6000h-7FFFh (W)
  0-6  Select 8Kbyte BW-RAM Block for mapping to 6000h-7FFFh (0..31 or 0..127)
  7    Select source (0=Normal/Bank 40h..43h, 1=Bitmap/Bank 60h..6Fh)

223Fh SA-1 BBF - BW-RAM Bit Map Format for 600000h-6FFFFFh (W)
  0-6 Not used (should be "..") (whatever ".." means, maybe "0"?)
  7   Format (0=4bit, 1=2bit)
"BW-RAM bitmap logical space format setting from perspective of the SA-1 CPU"
  600000h.Bit0-1 or Bit0-3 mirrors to 400000h.Bit0-1 or 400000h.Bit0-3
  600001h.Bit0-1 or Bit0-3 mirrors to 400000h.Bit2-3 or 400000h.Bit4-7
  600002h.Bit0-1 or Bit0-3 mirrors to 400000h.Bit4-5 or 400001h.Bit0-3
  600003h.Bit0-1 or Bit0-3 mirrors to 400000h.Bit6-7 or 400001h.Bit4-7
  etc.
Note that the LSBs in the packed-area contain the left-most pixel (not the
right-most one). The MSBs in the unpacked area are "ignored" (this is obvious
in case of writing; for reading it's unknown what it means - are reads
supported at all, and if so, do they return zero's or garbage in MSBs?)

2226h SNES SBWE - SNES CPU BW-RAM Write Enable (W)
2227h SA-1 SBWE - SA-1 CPU BW-RAM Write Enable (W)
  0-6  Not used (should be 0)
  7    Write Enable BW-RAM (0=Protect, 1=Write Enable)

2228h SNES BWPA - BW-RAM Write-Protected Area (W)
  0-3  Select size of Write-Protected Area ("256 SHL N" bytes)
  4-7  Not used (should be 0)
Selects how many bytes (originated at 400000h) shall be write protected.
It isn't possible to set the size to "none" (min is 256 bytes), though, one can
probably completely disable the protection via ports 2226h/2227h?

2229h SNES SIWP - SNES I-RAM Write-Protection (W)
222Ah SA-1 CIWP - SA-1 I-RAM Write-Protection (W)
  0-7  Write enable flags for eight 256-byte chunks (0=Protect, 1=Write Enable)
Bit0 for I-RAM 3000h..30FFh, bit1 for 3100h..31FFh, etc. bit7 for 3700h..37FFh.

SNES Cart SA-1 DMA Transfers
----------------------------

2230h SA-1 DCNT - DMA Control (W)
  0-1 DMA Source Device      (0=ROM, 1=BW-RAM, 2=I-RAM, 3=Reserved);\for
  2   DMA Destination Device (0=I-RAM, 1=BW-RAM)                   ;/Normal DMA
  3   Not used (should be 0)
  4   DMA Char Conversion Type (0=Type 2/Semi-Automatic, 1=Type 1/Automatic)
  5   DMA Char Conversion Enable (0=Normal DMA, 1=Character Conversion DMA)
  6   DMA Priority (0=SA-1 CPU Priority, 1=DMA Priority) ;<-- for Normal DMA
  7   DMA Enable (0=Disable, 1=Enable... and Clear Parameters?)
Bit6 is only valid for Normal DMA between BW-RAM and I-RAM. Source and
Destination may not be the same devices (ie. no I-RAM to I-RAM, or BW-RAM to
BW-RAM).

2231h Both CDMA - Character Conversion DMA Parameters (W)
  0-1 Color Depth (0=8bit, 1=4bit, 2=2bit, 3=Reserved)
  2-4 Virtual VRAM Width (0..5 = 1,2,4,8,16,32 characters) (6..7=Reserved)
  5-6 Not used (should be 0)
  7   Terminate Character Conversion 1 (0=No change, 1=Terminate DMA)

2232h Both SDA - DMA Source Device Start Address Lsb (W)
2233h Both SDA - DMA Source Device Start Address Mid (W)
2234h Both SDA - DMA Source Device Start Address Msb (W)
  0-23  24bit Memory Address (translated to 23bit ROM Offset via 2220h..2223h)
  0-17  18bit BW-RAM Offset
  0-10  11bit I-RAM Offset
Used bits are 24bit/18bit/11bit for ROM/BW-RAM/I-RAM.

2235h Both DDA - DMA Destination Device Start Address Lsb (W)
2236h Both DDA - DMA Destination Device Start Address Mid (Start/I-RAM) (W)
2237h Both DDA - DMA Destination Device Start Address Msb (Start/BW-RAM)(W)
  0-17  BW-RAM Offset (transfer starts after writing 2237h)
  0-10  I-RAM Offset  (transfer starts after writing 2236h) (2237h is unused)

2238h SA-1 DTC - DMA Terminal Counter Lsb (W)
2239h SA-1 DTC - DMA Terminal Counter Msb (W)
  0-15  DMA Transfer Length in bytes (1..65535) (0=Reserved/unknown)
DTC is used only for Normal DMA (whilst Character Conversion DMA lasts endless;
for Type 1: as long as SNES reads "BW-RAM" / until it sets 2231h.Bit7, for Type
2: as long as SA-1 writes BRF / until it clears 2230h.Bit0).

224xh SA-1 BRF - Bit Map Register File (2240h..224Fh) (W)
These 16 registers can hold two 8 pixel rows (with 2bit/4bit/8bit per pixel).
  0-1  2bit pixel (bit 2-7=unused)
  0-3  4bit pixel (bit 4-7=unused)
  0-7  8bit pixel
Used only for (semi-automatic) Character Conversion Type 2, where the "DMA"
source data is to be written pixel-by-pixel to these registers; writing to one
8 pixel row can be done while transferring the other row to the SNES.

Normal DMA (memory transfer within cartridge memory)
  ROM    --> I-RAM     10.74MHz
  ROM    --> BW-RAM    5.37MHz
  BW-RAM --> I-RAM     5.37MHz
  I-RAM  --> BW-RAM    5.37MHz
For normal DMA:
  Set DCNT (select source/dest/prio/enable)
  Set SDA (set source offset)
  Set DTC (set transfer length)
  Set DDA (set destination offset, and start transfer)
  If desired, wait for CFR.Bit5 (DMA completion interrupt)
Normal DMA is used by J. League '96, Jumpin Derby, Marvelous. For ROM, SDA
should be usually C00000h and up (HiROM mapping); Jumpin Derby is
unconventionally using SDA at 2x8xxxh and up (LoROM mapping).

Character Conversion DMA
Used to convert bitmaps or pixels to bit-planed tiles. For details, see
--> SNES Cart SA-1 Character Conversion

SNES DMA (via Port 43xxh)
Can be used to transfer "normal" data from ROM/BW-RAM/I-RAM to SNES memory,
also used for forwarding temporary Character Conversion data from I-RAM to
SNES.

Unknown details
Unknown if SDA/DDA are increased and if DTC is decreased (or if that operations
appear only on internal registers) (MSBs of DDA are apparently NOT increased on
char conversion DMAs).

SNES Cart SA-1 Character Conversion
-----------------------------------

Character Conversion Types
  Conversion  DMA-Transfer     Source / Pixel-Format
  Type 1      Automatic        BW-RAM, Packed Pixels, Bitmap Pixel Array
  Type 2      Semi-Automatic   CPU, Unpacked Pixels, 8x8 Pixel Tiles
Both Conversion types are writing data to a temporary buffer in I-RAM:
  I-RAM buffer 32/64/128 bytes (two 8x8 tiles at 2bit/4bit/8bit color depth)
From that buffer, data is forwarded to SNES (via a simultanously executed SNES
DMA, ie. via ports 43xxh).

Character Conversion 1 - Automatically Convert Packed BW-RAM Pixels
Can be used only if the cartridge DOES contain BW-RAM (most or all do so).
First, do this on SA-1 side:
  Set DCNT (Port 2230h) set to Char Conversion Type 1   (...and no DMA-enable?)
Then do following on SNES side:
  Set SDA (Port 2232h-2234h)=BW-RAM offset, align by (bytes/char)*(chars/line)
  Set CDMA (Port 2231h) = store bits/pixel and chars/line
  Set DDA (Port 2235h-2236h)=I-RAM offset, align (bytes/char)*2 (2237h=unused)
  Wait for SFR.Bit5 (Port 2300h) Char_DMA_IRQ (=first character available)
  Launch SNES-DMA via Port 43xxh from "Virtual BW-RAM?" to PPU-VRAM
    (this can transfer the WHOLE bitmap in one pass)
Finally, after the SNES-DMA has finished, do this on SA-1 side:
  Set CDMA.Bit7=1 (Port 2231h) - terminate SA-1 DMA
    (that stops writing to I-RAM on SA-1 side)
    (and stops tile-data to be mapped to 400000h-43FFFFh on SNES-side)
During conversion, the SA-1 can execute other program code (but waits may occur
on BW-RAM and I-RAM accesses). The SNES CPU is paused (by the DMA) for most of
the time, except for the time slots shortly before/after the DMA; in that time
slots, the SNES may access I-RAM, but may not access BW-RAM.
Conversion 1 is used by Haruka Naru Augusta 3 and Pebble Beach no Hotou.

Character Conversion 2 - Semi-Automatic Convert Unpacked CPU Pixels
First, do this on SA-1 side:
  Set DCNT (Port 2230h) set to Char Conversion Type 2 and set DMA-enable
  Set CDMA (Port 2231h) = store bits/pixel (chars/line is not used)
  Set DDA (Port 2235h-2236h)=I-RAM offset, align (bytes/char)*2 (2237h=unused)
Then repeat for each character:
  for y=0 to 7, for x=0 to 7, [2240h+x+(y and 1)]=pixel(x,y), next x,y
  On SNES side: Transfer DMA from 1st/2nd I-RAM buffer half to VRAM or WRAM
Finally,
  Set DCNT.Bit7=0 (Port 2230h) - disable DMA
Conversion 2 is used by Haruka Naru Augusta 3 and SD Gundam G NEXT.

SNES Cart SA-1 Arithmetic Maths
-------------------------------

2250h SA-1 MCNT - Arithmetic Control (W)
  0-1 Arithmetic Mode (0=Multiply, 1=Divide, 2=MultiplySum, 3=Reserved)
  2-7 Not used (should be "..") (whatever ".." means, maybe "0"?)
Note: Writing Bit1=1 does reset the Sum (aka "Cumulative Sum" aka "Accumulative
Sum") to zero.

2251h SA-1 MA - Arithmetic Parameter A Lsb (Multiplicand/Dividend) (W)
2252h SA-1 MA - Arithmetic Parameter A Msb (Multiplicand/Dividend) (W)
  0-15  SIGNED multiplicand or dividend (that is, both are signed)
The value in this register is kept intact after multiplaction, but gets
destroyed after division.

2253h SA-1 MB - Arithmetic Parameter B Lsb (Multiplier/Divisor) (W)
2254h SA-1 MB - Arithmetic Parameter B Msb (Multiplier/Divisor)/Start (W)
  0-15  SIGNED multiply parameter, or UNSIGNED divisor
The value in this register gets destroyed after both multiplaction and
division. Writing to 2254h starts the operation. Execution time is 5 cycles (in
10.74MHz units) for both Multiply and Divide, and 6 cycles for Multiply/Sum.

2306h SA-1 MR - Arithmetic Result, bit0-7   (Sum/Product/Quotient) (R)
2307h SA-1 MR - Arithmetic Result, bit8-15  (Sum/Product/Quotient) (R)
2308h SA-1 MR - Arithmetic Result, bit16-23 (Sum/Product/Remainder) (R)
2309h SA-1 MR - Arithmetic Result, bit24-31 (Sum/Product/Remainder) (R)
230Ah SA-1 MR - Arithmetic Result, bit32-39 (Sum) (R)
  32bit Multiply Result    (SIGNED)
  40bit Multiply/Sum       (SIGNED)
  16bit Division Result    (SIGNED)
  16bit Division Remainder (UNSIGNED !!!)

230Bh SA-1 OF - Arithmetic Overflow Flag (R)
This bit is reportedly set on 40bit multiply/addition overflows (rather than on
more useful 32bit overflows), thereby overflow can't occur unless one is doing
at least 512 continous multiply/additions.
  0-6 Not used (reportedly "..") (whatever ".." means, maybe 0 or open bus?)
  7   Arithmetic Sum Overflow Flag (0=No overflow, 1=Overflow)
Unknown when this bit gets cleared (all operations, or mode changes)?

Division by zero returns result=0000h and remainder=0000h (other info claims
other values?) (but, as far as known, doesn't set set overflow flag).

SNES Cart SA-1 Variable-Length Bit Processing
---------------------------------------------

2258h SA-1 VBD - Variable-Length Bit Processing (W)
  0-3  Data Length (1..15=1..15 bits, or 0=16 bits)
  4-6  Not used (should be "..") (whatever ".." means, maybe "0"?)
  7    Data Read Mode (0=Fixed Mode, 1=Auto-increment)
Manual/Fixed Mode is used by Jumpin Derby. Auto-increment isn't used by any
known games.

2259h SA-1 VDA - Variable-Length Bit Game Pak ROM Start Address Lsb (W)
225Ah SA-1 VDA - Variable-Length Bit Game Pak ROM Start Address Mid (W)
225Bh SA-1 VDA - Variable-Length Bit Game Pak ROM Start Address Msb & Kick
  0-23  Game Pak ROM Address
Reading starts on writing to 225Bh.
The ROM address is probably originated at 000000h (rather than using
LoROM/HiROM like CPU addresses)?

230Ch SA-1 VDP - Variable-Length Data Read Port Lsb (R)
230Dh SA-1 VDP - Variable-Length Data Read Port Msb (R)
  0-15  Data
Unknown what happens on data length less than 16bits:
  Are the selected bits located in MSBs or LSBs?
  Are the other bits set to zero? To next/prev values? Sign-expanded??
There is an "auto-increment" feature, which may trigger on reading 230Ch? or on
reading or 230Dh?

;*******PRELOAD:
;Preload occurs after writing VDA
;        bitpos = [2259h]*8
;        [230Ch] = WORD[bitpos/8]

;*******INCREMENT:
;Increment occurs AFTER reading VDP (when auto-increment enabled),
;and after writing VDB (reportedly always, but SHOULD be ONLY when inc=off)?
;        bitpos=bitpos+(([2258h]-1) AND 0Fh)+1
;        [230Ch] = dword[bitpos/16*2] shr (bitpos and 15) AND FFFFh

SNES Cart GSU-n Memory Map
--------------------------

GSU Memory Map (at SNES Side)
  00-3F:3000-32FF  GSU I/O Ports
  00-3F:6000-7FFF  Mirror of fragment (err, which one(s)?) of Game Pak RAM
  00-3F:8000-FFFF  Game Pak ROM in LoRom mapping (2Mbyte max)
  40-5F:0000-FFFF  Game Pak ROM in HiRom mapping (mirror of above 2Mbyte)
  70-71:0000-FFFF  Game Pak RAM       (128Kbyte max, usually 32K or 64K)
  78-79:0000-FFFF  Additional "Backup" RAM  (128Kbyte max, usually none)
  80-BF:3000-32FF  Mirror of GSU I/O Ports
  80-BF:6000-7FFF  Mirror of fragment (err, which one(s)?) of Game Pak RAM
  80-BF:8000-FFFF  Additional "CPU" ROM LoROM (2Mbyte max, usually none)
  C0-FF:0000-FFFF  Additional "CPU" ROM HiROM (4Mbyte max, usually none)
For HiROM mapping the address bits are shifted, so both LoROM and HiROM are
linear (eg. Bank 40h contains mirrors of Bank 00h and 01h).
Although both LoROM and HiROM are supported, the header & exception vectors are
located at ROM Offset 7Fxxh (in LoROM fashion), accordingly the cartridge
header declares the cartridge as LoROM.
The additional ROM/RAM regions would be mapped to SNES CPU only (not to GSU),
they aren't installed in existing cartridges, that implies that the "Fast" ROM
banks (80h-FFh) are unused, so GSU games are restricted to "Slow" ROM.
The "unspecified" 8K fragment(s) at 6000h-7FFFh are used by Super Mario World
2; whereas, it seems as if ALL 8K fragments do mirror to the FIRST 8K of Game
Pak RAM?

GSU Memory Map (at GSU Side)
  00-3F:0000-7FFF  Mirror of LoROM at 00-3F:8000-FFFF (for "GETB R15" vectors)
  00-3F:8000-FFFF  Game Pak ROM in LoRom mapping (2Mbyte max)
  40-5F:0000-FFFF  Game Pak ROM in HiRom mapping (mirror of above 2Mbyte)
  70-71:0000-FFFF  Game Pak RAM       (128Kbyte max, usually 32K or 64K)
  PBR:0000-01FF    Code-Cache (when having manually stored opcodes in it)
PBR can be set to both ROM/RAM regions (or cache region), ROMBR only to ROM
region (00h-5Fh), RAMBR only to RAM region (70h-71h).

GSU Interrupt Vectors
The SNES Exception Vectors (at FFE4h-FFFFh) are normally located in Game Pak
ROM. When the GSU is running (with GO=1 and RON=1), ROM isn't mapped to SNES
memory, instead, fixed values are appearing as ROM (depending of the lower 4bit
of the address):
  Any Address     Exception Vectors
  [xxx0h]=0100h   -
  [xxx2h]=0100h   -
  [xxx4h]=0104h   [FFE4h]=0104h  COP Vector in 65C816 mode (COP opcode)
  [xxx6h]=0100h   [FFE6h]=0100h  BRK Vector in 65C816 mode (BRK opcode)
  [xxx8h]=0100h   [FFE8h]=0100h  ABT Vector in 65C816 mode (Not used in SNES)
  [xxxAh]=0108h   [FFEAh]=0108h  NMI Vector in 65C816 mode (Vblank)
  [xxxCh]=0100h   -
  [xxxEh]=010Ch   [FFEEh]=010Ch  IRQ Vector in 65C816 mode (H/V-IRQ & GSU-STOP)
It'd be best to set the Game Pak ROM vectors to the same addresses, otherwise
the vectors would change when the GSU is running (or possibly, the fixed-LSBs
may be mixed-up with ROM-MSBs).

GSU Cartridge Header (always at ROM Offset 7Fxxh, in LoROM fashion)
  [FFD5h]=20h        Set to "Slow/LoROM" (although both LoROM/HiROM works)
  [FFD6h]=13h..1Ah   Chipset = GSUn (plus battery present/absent info)
  [FFD8h]=00h        Normal SRAM Size (None) (always use the Expansion entry)
  [FFBDh]=05h..06h   Expansion RAM Size (32Kbyte and 64Kbyte exist)
  Caution: Starfox/Star Wing, Powerslide, and Starfox 2 do not have extended
  headers (and thereby no [FFBDh] entry). RAM Size for Starfox/Starwing is
  32Kbytes, RAM Size for Powerslide and Starfox 2 is unknown.
There is no info in the header (nor extended header) whether the game uses a
GSU1 or GSU2. Games with 2MByte ROM are typically using GSU2 (though that rule
doesn't always match: Star Fox 2 is only 1MByte).

GSU Busses
The GSU seems to have 4 address/data busses (three external ones, and one
internal cache bus):
  SNES bus (for forwarding ROM/RAM access to SNES)
  ROM bus (for GSU opcode fetches, GETxx reads, and SNES reads)
  RAM bus (for GSU opcode fetches, LOAD/STORE/PLOT/RPIX, and SNES access)
  Code cache bus (for GSU opcode fetches only) (and SNES I/O via 3100h..32FFh)
To some level, this allows to do multiple things simultaneously: Reading a GSU
opcode from cache at the same time while prefetching ROM data and forwarding
the RAM or Pixel cache to RAM.

SNES Cart GSU-n I/O Map
-----------------------

GSU I/O Map (in banks 00h-3Fh and 80h-BFh)
During GSU operation, only SFR, SCMR, and VCR may be accessed.
According to official specs, 16bit registers MUST be accessed LSB first (no
idea what happens otherwise... is there a 1st/2nd access flipflop or so?).
  3000h-3001h R0  Default source/destination register (Sreg/Dreg) (R/W)

SNES Cart GSU-n General I/O Ports
---------------------------------

3000h-301Fh - R0-R15 - CPU Registers (R/W)
16bit CPU registers (see GSU I/O map for additional details on each register).
The GSU operation starts when writing to the MSB of R15 (the Program Counter).

3030h/3031h - SFR - Status/Flag Register (R/W)
  0  -    Always 0
  1  Z    Zero Flag     (0=NotZero/NotEqual, 1=Zero/Equal)
  2  CY   Carry Flag    (0=Borrow/NoCarry, 1=Carry/NoBorrow)
  3  S    Sign Flag     (0=Positive, 1=Negative)
  4  OV   Overflow Flag (0=NoOverflow, 1=Overflow)
  5  GO Set by GSU is running (cleared on STOP) (can be forcefully=0 via 3030h)
  6  R    ROM[R14] Read (0=No, 1=Reading ROM via R14 address)
  7  -    Always 0
  8  ALT1 Prefix Flag           ;\for ALT1,ALT2,ALT3 prefixes
  9  ALT2 Prefix Flag           ;/
  10 IL   Immediate lower 8bit flag ;\Unknown, probably set/reset internally
  11 IH   Immediate upper 8bit flag ;/when processing opcodes with imm operands
  12 B    Prefix Flag           ;-for WITH prefix (used by MOVE/MOVES opcodes)
  13 -    Always 0
  14 -    Always 0
  15 IRQ  Interrupt Flag (reset on read, set on STOP) (also set if IRQ masked?)
This register is read/write-able even when the GSU is running; reading mainly
makes sense for checking GO and IRQ bits, writing allows to clear the GO flag
(thereby aborting the GSU program; the write does most likely also destroy the
other SFR bits, so one cannot pause/resume).

3034h - PBR - Program Bank Register (8bit, bank 00h..5Fh,70h..71h) (R/W)
3036h - ROMBR - Game Pak ROM Bank Register (8bit, bank 00h..5Fh) (R)
303Ch - RAMBR - Game Pak RAM Bank Register (1bit, bank 70h..71h) (R)
Memory banks for GSU opcode/data accesses. PBR can be set to both ROM and RAM
regions, ROMBR/RAMBR only to ROM or RAM regions respectively. Existing
cartridges have only 32Kbyte or 64Kbyte RAM, so RAMBR should be always zero.
According to book2 (page 258), the screen base is also affected by RAMBR
(unknown if that is true, theoretically, SCBR is large enough to address more
than 64Kbytes without RAMBR).

303Eh/303Fh - CBR - Cache Base Register (upper 12bit; lower 4bit=unused) (R)
Code-Cache Base for Game Pak ROM/RAM. The register is read-only, so the SNES
cannot directly write to it, however, the SNES can set CBR=0000h by writing
GO=0 (in SFR register).

3033h - BRAMR - Back-up RAM Register (W)
  0   BRAM Flag (0=Disable/Protect, 1=Enable)
  1-7 Not used (should be zero)
This register would be used only if the PCB does have a separate "Backup" RAM
chip mapped to 780000h-79FFFFh (additionally to the Game Pak RAM chip). None of
the existing PCBs is having that extra RAM chip, so the register is having no
function. (Note: However, some PCBs do include a battery wired to Game Pak RAM
chip, anyways, that type of "backup" isn't affected by this register).

303Bh - VCR - Version Code Register (R)
  0-7 GSU Chip Version (??=MC1, ??=GSU1, ??=GSU1A, ??=GSU2, ??=GSU2-SP1)

3037h - CFGR - Config Register (W)
  0-4 -   Not used (should be zero)
  5   MS0 Multiplier Speed Select (0=Standard, 1=High Speed Mode)
  6   -   Not used (should be zero)
  7   IRQ Interrupt Mask (0=Trigger IRQ on STOP opcode, 1=Disable IRQ)
MS0 <must> be zero in 21MHz mode (ie. only CFGR.Bit5 or CLSR.Bit0 may be set).

3039h - CLSR - Clock Select Register (W)
  0   CLS Clock Select (0=10.7MHz, 1=21.4MHz)
  1-7 -   Not used (should be zero)
Unknown if this register is implemented in all GSU versions; MC1/GSU-1 are
reportedly always running at 10.7MHz(?).

N/A - ROM Buffer - Prefetched Byte(s?) at [ROMBR:R14]
N/A - Sreg/Dreg - Memorized TO/FROM Prefix Selections
3100h..32FFh - Cache RAM

SNES Cart GSU-n Bitmap I/O Ports
--------------------------------

3038h - SCBR - Screen Base Register (8bit, in 1Kbyte units) (W)
  0-7  Screen Base in 1K-byte Units (Base = 700000h+N*400h)

303Ah - SCMR - Screen Mode Register (W)
  0-1 MD0-1 Color Gradient (0=4-Color, 1=16-Color, 2=Reserved, 3=256-Color)
  2   HT0   Screen Height  (0=128-Pixel, 1=160-Pixel, 2=192-Pixel, 3=OBJ-Mode)
  3   RAN   Game Pak RAM bus access (0=SNES, 1=GSU)
  4   RON   Game Pak ROM bus access (0=SNES, 1=GSU)
  5   HT1   Screen Height  (MSB of HT0 bit)
  6-7 -     Not used (should be zero)
RON/RAN can be temporarily cleared during GSU operation, this causes the GSU to
enter WAIT status (if it accesses ROM or RAM), and continues when RON/RAN are
changed back to 1.
Note that "OBJ Mode" can be also selected by POR.Bit4 (if so, HT0/HT1 bits are
ignored).

  256x128 pixels   256x160 pixels   256x192 pixels   OBJ Mode 256x256 pixel
  000 010 .. 1F0 | 000 014 .. 26C | 000 018 .. 1E8 | 000 .. 00F 100 .. 10F

  00F 01F .. 1FF | 013 027 .. 27F | 017 02F .. 2FF | 2F0 .. 2FF 3F0 .. 3FF
In the first three cases, BG Map is simply filled with columns containing
increasing tile numbers. The fourth case is matched to the SNES two-dimensional
OBJ mapping; it can be used for BG Map (with entries 0..3FF as shown above), or
for OBJ tiles (whereas, mind that the SNES supports only 0..1FF OBJs, not
200..3FF).

The Tile Number is calculated as:
  Height 128 --> (X/8)*10h + (Y/8)
  Height 160 --> (X/8)*14h + (Y/8)
  Height 192 --> (X/8)*18h + (Y/8)
  OBJ Mode --> (Y/80h)*200h + (X/80h)*100h + (Y/8 AND 0Fh)*10h + (X/8 AND 0Fh)
The Tile-Row Address is:
  4 Color Mode    TileNo*10h + SCBR*400h + (Y AND 7)*2
  16 Color Mode   TileNo*20h + SCBR*400h + (Y AND 7)*2
  256 Color Mode  TileNo*40h + SCBR*400h + (Y AND 7)*2
With Plane0,1 stored at Addr+0, Plane 2,3 at Addr+10h, Plane 4,5 at Addr+20h,
Plane 6,7 at Addr+30h.


N/A - COLR - Color Register
  0-7 CD0-7 Color Data

N/A - POR - Plot Option Register (CMODE)
  0   PLOT Transparent       (0=Do Not Plot Color 0, 1=Plot Color 0)
  1   PLOT Dither            (0=Normal, 1=Dither; 4/16-color mode only)
  2   COLOR/GETC High-Nibble (0=Normal, 1=Replace incoming LSB by incoming MSB)
  3   COLOR/GETC Freeze-High (0=Normal, 1=Write-protect COLOR.MSB)
  4   OBJ Mode               (0=Normal, 1=Force OBJ mode; ignore SCMR.HT0/HT1)
  5-7 Not used (should be zero)
Can be changed by CMODE opcode, used for COLOR/GETC/PLOT opcodes.
Dither can mix transparent & non-transparent pixels.

Bit0=0 (Transparent) causes PLOT to skip color 0 (so PLOT does only increment
R1 (X-coordinate), but doesn't draw a pixel). Depending on color depth, the
color 0 check tests the lower 2/4/8 bits of the drawing color (if POR.Bit3
(Freeze-High) is set, then it checks only the lower 2/4 bits, and ignores upper
4bit even when in 256-color mode).
Bit1=1 (Dither) causes PLOT to use dithering, that is, if "(r1.bit0 XOR
r2.bit0)=1" then COLOR/10h is used as drawing color; using Color 0 as one of
the two colors can produce a semi-transparency effect. Dither is ignored in
256-color mode.
Bit2=1 (High-Nibble) causes COLOR/GETC to replace the LSB of the incoming data
by the MSB of the incoming data; this allows two 4bit bitmaps being stored at
the same memory area (one in the LSBs, the other in MSBs).
Bit3=1 (Freeze-High) causes COLOR/GETC to change only the LSB of the color
register; this allows the MSB to be used as fixed palette-like value in
256-color mode, it might be also useful for fixed dither-colors in 4/16 color
mode.
Bit3=1 forces OBJ Mode (same as when setting SCMR.HT0/HT1 to OBJ Mode).

  3F 8n (?)     UMULT #n    2,3  000-s-z  ;Dreg = unsigned(SregLsb * #n)
The multiply speed can be selected via CFGR register. Do not use FMULT with
Dreg=R4 (this will reportedly leave R4 unchanged). When using LMULT with
Dreg=R4 then the result will be R4=MSB (and LSB is lost). Ie. if that is true
then, strangely, LMULT R4 <does> work as how FMULT R4 <should> work.

  3D 9n         LJMP Rn       2  000----  ;R15=Sreg, PBR=Rn, CBR=? ;n=8..13 !
Jumps can be also implemented by using R15 (PC) as destination register (eg. in
MOV/ALU commands).
Observe that the NEXT BYTE after any jump/branch opcodes is fetched before
continuing at the jump destination address. The fetched by is executed after
the jump, but before executing following opcodes at the destination (in case of
multi-byte opcodes, this results in a 1-byte-fragment being located after the
jump-origin, and the remaining byte(s) at the destination).

GSU Prefix Opcodes
ALT1/ALT2/ALT3 prefixes do change the operation of an opcode, these are usually
implied in the opcode description (for example, "3F 6n" is "CMP R0,Rn").
TO/WITH/FROM prefixes allow to select source/destination registers (otherwise
R0 is used as default register) (for example, "Bs 3F 6n" is "CMP Rs,Rn").
The prefixes are normally reset after execution of any opcode, the only
exception are the Bxx (branch) opcodes, these leave prefixes unchanged
(allowing to "split" opcodes, for example placing ALT1/TO/etc. before Bxx, and
the next opcode byte after Bxx).
Aside from setting Sreg+Dreg, WITH does additionally set the B-flag, this
causes any following 1nh/Bnh bytes to act as MOVE/MOVES opcodes (rather than as
TO/FROM prefixes).
  Opcode        Name       Bflg ALT1 ALT2 Sreg Dreg
  3D            ALT1       -    1    -    -    -    ;prefix for 3D xx opcodes
  3E            ALT2       -    -    1    -    -    ;prefix for 3E xx opcodes
  3F            ALT3       -    1    1    -    -    ;prefix for 3F xx opcodes
  1n            TO Rn      -    -    -    -    Rn   ;select Rn as Dreg
  2n            WITH Rn    1    -    -    Rn   Rn   ;select Rn as Dreg & Sreg
  Bn            FROM Rn    -    -    -    Rn   -    ;select Rn as Sreg
  05..0F nn     Bxx addr   -    -    -    -    -    ;branch opcodes (no change)
  other         other      0    0    0    R0   R0   ;other opcodes (reset all)
Other opcodes do reset B=0, ALT1=0, ALT2=0, Sreg=R0, Dreg=R0; that does really
apply to ALL other opcodes, namely including JMP/LOOP (unlike Bxx branches),
NOP (ie. NOP isn't exactly <no> operation), MOVE/MOVES (where 1n/Bn are treated
as 'real' opcodes rather than as TO/FROM prefixes).

Ignored Prefixes
ALT1/ALT2 prefixes are ignored if the opcode doesn't exist (eg. if "3D xx"
doesn't exist, then the CPU does instead execute "xx") (normally, doing that
wouldn't make any sense, however, "Doom" is using ALT1/ALT2 alongside with
conditional jumps, resulting in situations where the prefix is used/ignored
depending on the jump condition).
ALT3 does reportedly mirror to ALT1 (eg. if "3F xx" doesn't exist, then it acts
as "3D xx", and, if that doesn't either, as "xx").
TO/WITH/FROM are ignored if the following opcode doesn't use Dreg/Sreg.

GSU Special Opcodes
  00            STOP          1  000----  ;GO=0, trigger SNES IRQ
  01            NOP           1  000----  ;NOP (often used as dummy after jump)
  02            CACHE         1* 000----  ;IF CBR<>PC&FFF0 then CBR=PC&FFF0

Program Counter (R15) Notes
R15 can be used as source operand in MOV/ALU opcodes (and is also implied as
such in Bxx,LINK,CACHE opcodes); in all cases R15 contains the address of the
next opcode.

SNES Cart GSU-n CPU Misc
------------------------

Uncached ROM/RAM-Read-Timings
  ROM Read:   5 cycles per byte at 21MHz, or 3 cycles per byte at 10MHz
  RAM Write: 10 cycles per word at 21MHz, or unknown at 10MHz?
  RAM Write: unknown number of cycles per byte?
  ROM/RAM Opcode-byte-read: 3 cycles at both 21MHz and 10MHz?
The uncached timings aren't well documented. Possibly ROM/RAM-byte read/write
are all having the same timing (3/5 clks at 10/21MHz) (and RAM-word 6/10)?

Jump Notes
Jumps can be implemented by JMP/Bxx opcodes, or by using R15 as destination
register. In all cases, the next BYTE after the jump opcode is fetched as
opcode byte, and is executed before continuing at the jump-target address.
Possible situations are:
  1) jump + NOP                 ;very simple
  2) jump + ONE-BYTE-OPCODE     ;still quite simple
  3) jump + MULTI-BYTE-OPCODE   ;rather strange
  4) Prefix + jump + ONE-BYTE-SUFFIX
  5) Prefix + jump + MULTI-BYTE-SUFFIX
In case 3, the first opcode-byte is picked from the address after jump, the
following byte(s) from the jump-destination.
In case 4/5, the prefix is located before the jump, the next byte after the
jump (this works only with Bxx jumps) (whilst JMP/LJMP or MOV/ALU R15,dest do
reset the prefix), and any further bytes at the jump-destination.

Mistakes in book2.pdf
BGE/BLT are exchanged with each other. MOVES src/dst operands are exchanged.
LJMP bank/offs operands are exchanged.

GSU Undoc opcodes
UMULT #n, WITH, XOR Rn, XOR #n are sorts of undocumented; they should be
described (on page 280), but the alphabetical list ends abruptly after UMULT
Rn. However, they are listed in the summary (page 101) and in the index (page
409). The WITH opcode is also mentioned in various other places.

page 121: R15 after STOP (strange, is that true?)
page 122: cache/cbr after ABORT

MOV R13,R15  sets R13 to addr of next opcode after MOV (eg. for LOOP start)
LINK n       sets R11 to addr+n of next opcode (eg. for "CALLs" via jmp)

GSU Power Consumption
The GSU does (when it is running) increase the power consumption, this can
overload the SNES power supply if additional peripherals are connected. GSU
software should detect which controllers are connected, and refuse to start the
GSU if a controller with high power consumption (or with unknown power
consumption) is connected. The standard joypads are okay. A Multiplayer 5
adaptor isn't okay (at least, when multiple controllers are connected to it).

After STOP
Restarting (somewhere(?) after STOP) is possible by setting GO-flag (done by
Dirt Trax FX).

SNES Cart GSU-n Code-Cache
--------------------------

ROM/RAM-Code-Cache (512-byte cache)
This cache is used only for Opcode fetches from ROM or RAM (not for
reading/writing Data to/from ROM nor RAM) (however, it does slightly increase
data access speed in so far that data can be read/written via Gamepak bus,
simultaneously while fetching opcodes from the cache).
32 lines of 16-bytes.
CACHE
LJMP
STOP
ABORT
after STOP, one "must" clear GO by software to clear the cache

Cache Area
"SNES_Addr = (CBR AND 1FFh)+3100h". For example, a CACHE opcode at C3A5h will
set CBR to C3A0h, and the (initially empty) cached region will be C3A0h..C59Fh,
when code gets loaded into the cache, GSU:C3A0h..C3FFh shows up at
SNES:32A0h..32FFh, and GSU:C400h..C59Fh at SNES:3100h..329Fh.

Writing to Code-Cache (by SNES CPU)
First of, set GO=0 (ie. write SFR=0000h), this forces CBR=0000h, and marks all
cache lines as empty. Then write opcodes 16-byte lines at 3100h..32FFh, writing
the last byte of a line at [3xxFh] will mark the line as not-empty.
Thereafter, the cached code can be excuted (by setting R15 to 0000h..01Fxh), in
this case, the GSU can be operated without RON/RAN flags being set - unless R15
leaves the cached area (this occurs also when a STOP is located in last byte of
last cache line; the hardware tries to prefetch one byte after STOP), or unless
ROM-DATA is accessed (via GETxx opcodes) or unless RAM-DATA is accessed (via
LOAD/STORE or PLOT/RPIX opcodes). Ie. usually one would have RAN set (unless
all incoming/outgoing parameters can be passed though R0..R14 registers).

Code-Cache Loading Notes
The 16-byte cache-lines are loaded alongside while executing opcodes (rather
than first loading the whole 16-byte-line, and then executing the opcodes
within it; which would be slightly slower). There are two special cases related
to jumps: If current cache-line isn't fully loaded then hardware keeps loading
the remaining bytes (from jump-origin to end-of-line). If the jump-target isn't
aligned by 16 (and isn't yet cached), then the hardware loads the leading bytes
(from start-of-line to jump-target). After that two steps, normal execution
continues at the jump-target address.
The leading-stuff also occurs on CACHE instruction.
  CACHE sets CBR to "R15 AND FFF0h" (whereas R15=address after CACHE opcode)
  LJMP sets CBR to "R15 AND FFF0h" (whereas R15=jump target address)
  SNES write to SFR register with GO=0 sets CBR=0000h
  (all of the above three cases do also mark all cache lines as empty)

All Code-Cache lines are marked as empty when executing CACHE or LJMP opcodes,
or when the SNES clears the GO flag (by writing to SFR). The STOP opcode
however (which also clears GO), doesn't empty the cache, so one may eventually
re-use the cached values when restarting the GSU (however, if PBR or code in
GamePak RAM has changed, then one must clear the cache by writing GO=0).

According to cache description (page 132), Cache-Code is 6 times faster than
ROM/RAM. However, according to opcode descriptions (page 160 and up), cache is
only 3 times faster than ROM/RAM. Whereas, maybe 6 times refers to 21MHz mode,
and 3 times to 10MHz mode?

The CACHE opcode is typically executed prior to loops and/or at the begin of
often-used sub-functions (or ideally, the loop and any used subfunctions should
both fit into the 512-byte cache region).

SNES Cart GSU-n Pixel-Cache
---------------------------

RAM-Pixel-Write-Cache (two 8-pixel rows)

pixel cache is flushed when:
  1) cache full
  2) doing rpix <--- this does also WAIT until it is flushed
  3) changing r1 or r2 (really?)

Pixel Cache
Primary Pixel Cache (written to by PLOT)
Secondary Pixel Cache (data copied from Primary Cache, this WAITs if Secondary
cache wasn't yet forwarded to RAM) (if less than 8 flags are set, data is
merged with old RAM data).
Each cache contains 8 pixels (with 2bit/4bit/8bit depth), plus 8 flags
(indicating if (nontransparent) pixels were plotted).
Pixel X/Y coordinates are 8bit wide (using LSBs of R1/R2 registers).
(X and F8h) and (Y and FFh) are memorized, when plotting to different values,
Primary cache is forwarded to Secondary Cache, this happens also when all 8
cache flags are set.
Do not change SCREEN MODE (how to do that at all while GSU is running?) when
data is in pixel caches (use RPIX to force the caches to be flushed). Before
STOP opcode, do also use RPIX to force the caches to be flushed.
RPIX isn't cached, it does always read data from RAM, not from cache. Moreover,
before reading RAM, RPIX does force both pixel caches (unless they are empty)
to be forwarded to RAM. This is making RPIX very slow (trying to read/modify
pixels via RPIX+PLOT would work very slow). So far, RPIX is mainly useful for
forcing the pixel caches to be forwarded to RAM (and to WAIT until that
forwarding has completed).

SNES Cart GSU-n Other Caches
----------------------------

ROM-Read-Data Cache (1-byte read-ahead)
The cache is used for GETB/GETBS/GETBL/GETBH/GETC opcodes (which do read from
[ROMBR:R14]). Loading the cache is invoked by any opcodes that do change R14
(such like ADD,MOVE,etc.), allowing following GETxx opcodes to be executed
without Waitstates.
In some situations WAITs can occur: When the cache-load hasn't yet completed
(ie. GETxx executed shortly after changing R14), when an opcode is fetched from
ROM (rather than from RAM or Code-Cache), when ROMBR is changed (caution: in
this special case following GETxx will receive [OldROMBR:R14] rather than
[NewROMBR:R14]).
Caution: Do not execute the CACHE opcode shortly (7 cycles in 21MHz mode, or 4
cycles in 10MHz mode) after changing R14 (when doing that, the read from R14
will fail somehow, and following GETxx will return garbage).
Unknown if SNES writes to R14 (via Port 301Ch) do also prefetch [R14] data?

RAM-Write-Data Cache (1-byte/1-word write queue)
This cache is used for STB/STW/SM/SMS/SBK opcodes. After any such store
opcodes, the written byte/word is memorized in the cache, and further opcodes
can be fetched (from ROM or from Code-Cache) immediately without Waitstates,
simultaneously with the cached value being forwarded to RAM.
In some situations WAITs can occur: When cache already contained data (ie. when
executing two store opcodes shortly after each other), when an opcode is
fetched from RAM (rather than from ROM or Code-Cache), when the RAMBR register
is changed (this works as expected, it finishes the write to [OldRAMBR:nnnn]).
Results on doing Data-RAM-Reads while the Data-RAM-write is still busy are
unknown (possibly, this will WAIT, too) (or it may return garbage)?
WAITs should also occur when the pixel-cache gets emptied?

RAM-Address-Cache (1 word) (Bulk Processing for read-modify-write)
This very simple cache memorizes the most recently used RAM address (from
LM/LMS opcodes, and probably also from LDB/LDW/STB/STW/SM/SMS opcodes; though
some games insert STW to push data on stack, as if they were intended not to
change the memorized address?), the SBK opcode can be used to write a word to
the memorized address (ie. one can avoid repeating immediate operands in SM/SMS
opcodes).

All values are little-endian (opcodes, I/O Ports, cx4rom-ROM-Image, etc).
Call Stack is reportedly 16 levels deep, at least 16bits per level.
Carry Flag is CLEARED on borrow (ie. opposite as on 80x86 CPUs).

CX4 Timings (Unknown)
All opcode & DMA timings are 100% unknown. The CX4 is said to be clocked at
20.000MHz, but this might be internally divided, possibly with different
waitstates for different memory regions or different opcodes.
The ROM speed is 2.68Mhz (according to the cartridge header), and 16bit opcodes
are (seemingly) passed through 8bit databus (though one may assume that the CX4
contains an opcode cache) (cache might be divided into 200h-byte pages, so,
far-jumps to other pages might be slow, maybe/guessed).
The "skip" opcodes are "jumping" to the location after the next opcode (this
probably faster than the actual "jmp" opcodes).
After Multiply opcodes one should insert one "nop" (or another instruction that
doesn't access the MH or ML result registers).
Reading data bytes from SNES ROM requires some complex timing/handling:
  612Eh   movb   ext_dta,[ext_ptr]          ;\these 3 opcodes are used to
  4000h   inc    ext_ptr                    ; read one byte from [ext_ptr],
  1C00h   finish ext_dta                    ;/and to increment ext_ptr by 1
The exact meaning of the above opcodes is unknown (which one does what part?).
It is also allowed to use the middle opcode WITHOUT the "prepare/wait" part:
  4000h   inc    ext_ptr                    ;-increment ext_ptr by 1
In that case, "ext_ptr" is incremented, but "ext_dta" should not be used (might
be unchanged, or contain garbage, or receive data after some cycles?).

Exception Vectors
Unknown if these can be manually enabled, or if they are automatically enabled
when the CX4 is "busy". In the latter case, they would be REQUIRED to be same
as the ROM vectors (else LSB/MSB might be accidently fetched from different
locations when busy-flag changes at same time).

  000E:89  test_3K_rom_chksum  ;"immediate_rom"
Both Mega Man X2 and X3 are containing 1:1 the same CX4 code (the only two
differences are different ROM bank numbers for "Wireframe" vertices):
  Mega Man X2:  [0008:3B]="or a,a,28h"  [000A:C4]="mov a,28h"  ;ROM bank 28h
  Mega Man X3:  [0008:3B]="or a,a,08h"  [000A:C4]="mov a,08h"  ;ROM bank 08h
That differences apply to the US/Canada versions. There <might> be further
differences in Japanese and/or European versions(?)

SNES Cart DSP-n/ST010/ST011 (pre-programmed NEC uPD77C25 CPU) (23 games)
------------------------------------------------------------------------

Nintendo DSP-n Chips
The DSP-n chips are 28pin NEC uPD77C25 CPUs with internal ROM/RAM. There are
six versions:
  DSP-1, DSP-1A, DSP-1B, DSP-2, DSP-3, DSP-4
DSP-1 and DSP-1A contain exactly the same Program/Data ROM. DSP-1B contains a
bug-fixed DSP1/1A version. DSP2/3/4 contain custom ROMs.

Seta ST010/ST011 Chips
These are 64pin chips, containing a slightly extended NEC uPD77C25 with more
ROM and RAM, faster CPU clock.
  64pin  SETA ST010 D96050CW-012 (PCB SHVC-1DS0B-01)
  64pin  SETA ST011 D96050CW-013 (PCB same/similar as above?)
The onchip RAM is battery-backed and is accessible directly via SNES address
bus.

Game specific info
--> SNES Cart DSP-n/ST010/ST011 - List of Games using that chips
--> SNES Cart DSP-n/ST010/ST011 - BIOS Functions

DSPn/ST010/ST011 Cartridge Header
For DSPn Cartridges:
  [FFD6h]=03h..05h   Chipset = DSPn (plus battery present/absent info)
For ST010/ST011 Cartridges:
  [FFD6h]=F6h   Chipset = Custom (plus battery; for the on-chip RAM)
  [FFD4h]=00h   Last byte of Title=00h (indicate early extended header)
  [FFBFh]=01h   Chipset Sub Type = ST010/ST011
Note: The uPD77C25's ROM/RAM aren't counted in the ROM Size, ROM Checksum, SRAM
Size (nor Expansion RAM Size) entries. The header (nor extended header)
includes no info whether a DSPn game uses a DSP1, DSP2, DSP3, or DSP4, and no
info if a ST010/ST011 game uses ST010 or ST011. Ideally, the uPD77C25 ROM-Image
should be appended at the end of the SNES ROM-Image. In practice, it's often
not there, so there's no way to detect if the game uses this or that uPD77C25
ROM (except for using a list of known Titles or Checksums).

All banks in range 00-7F are also mirrored to 80-FF. The "LoROM (2MB)" type
wasn't actually produced (but is defined in Nintendo's specs, see book1.pdf
page 52).
For ST010/ST011, the RAM is contained in the ST01n chip, and is sized 2Kx16bit,
whereas the SNES accesses it as 4Kx8bit (even addresses accessing the LSB, odd
ones the MSB of the 16bit words).

Registers
  DP          8-bit Data RAM Pointer               (ST010/11: 11-bit)
  RP          10-bit Data ROM Pointer              (ST010/11: 11-bit)
  PC          11-bit Program ROM Counter           (ST010/11: 14-bit)
  STACK       11-bit x 4-levels (for call/ret/irq) (ST010/11: 14-bit x 8-level)
  K,L         two 16bit registers (multiplier input)
  AccA,AccB   two 16bit registers (ALU accumulators) (aka A and B)
  FlagA,FlagB two 6bit registers with S1,S0,C,Z,OV1,OV0 flags for AccA/AccB
  TR,TRB      two 16bit registers (temporary storage)
  SR          16bit status I/O register
  DR          parallel I/O data (selectable 8bit/16bit via SR's DRC bit)
  SI,SO       serial I/O data (selectable 8bit/16bit via SR's SOC,SIC bits)

FlagA/FlagB
  S0  Sign Flag     (set if result.bit15)
  Z   Zero Flag     (set if result=0000h)
  C   Carry Flag    (set if carry or borrow)
  OV0 Overflow Flag (set if result>+7FFFh or result<-8000h)
  S1  Direction of Last Overflow (if OV0 then S1=S0, else S1=unchanged)
  OV1 Number of Overflows (0=even, 1=odd) (inverted when OV0 gets set)
S0,Z,C,OV0 are "normal" flags as used by various CPUs. S1,OV1 are specials for
use with JSA1/JSB1/JNSA1/JNSB1 and JOVA1/JOVB1/JNOVA1/JNOVB1 conditional jump
opcodes, or with SGN operand (which equals 8000h-SA1). Examples:

Note: The JSA1/JSB1/JNSA1/JNSB1 and JOVA1/JOVB1/JNOVA1/JNOVB1 opcodes aren't
used by any of the DSP1-DSP4 or ST010-ST011 games. The SGN operand is used only
by DSP1/DSP1A/DSP1B (once in conjuntion with JNOVA0, which seems to be ALWAYS
skipping the SGN-part, and once in conjunction with an OR opcode, which loads
an undocumented value to SA1).

Status Register (SR)
  15    RQM (R)  Request for Master (0=Busy internally, 1=Request external I/O)
  14-13 USF1-0   User's Flags (general purpose)        (0=Low, 1=High)
  12    DRS (R)  DR Status (for 16bit DR mode; 2x8bit) (0=Ready, 1=Busy)
  11    DMA      Direct Memory Access Mode             (0=Non-DMA, 1=DMA)
  10    DRC      DR Control, parallel data length      (0=16bit, 1=8bit)
  9     SOC      SO Control, serial data output length (0=16bit, 1=8bit)

  7     EI       Interrupt Enable                      (0=Disable, 1=Enable)
  6-2   N/A (R?) Unused/Reserved  (should be zero) (read=always zero?)
  1-0   P1-0     Output to P0,P1 pins (0=Low, 1=High)
SR.Bit15-8 are output to D7-0 pins (when /CS=LOW, /RD=LOW, /WR=HIGH, A0=HIGH).
SR.Bit1-0 are always output to P1-0 pins.

RQM
RQM gets set when the uPD77C25 does read/write its DR register, and gets
cleared when the remote CPU does complete reading/writing DR (complete: when
DRC=8bit, or when DRC=16bit and DRS=Ready). DRS gets toggled in 16bit mode
after each 8bit fragment being read/written by remote CPU (the fragments are
transferred LSB first, then MSB).

DMA
The DRQ-pin isn't connected in SNES cartridges (since the DMA protocol isn't
compatible with the SNES), so there's no real DMA support. However, the
uPD77C25 (or at least the ST011) is fast enough to handle SNES-DMA transfers by
software. Software for DSP2 uses the 65C816's block-transfer command (which is
a bit slower than DMA, but, like DMA, doesn't use handshaking).

Memory
  2048 x 24bit Instruction ROM/PROM Opcodes
  2048 x 1bit  Instruction PROM Protection Flags (0=Lock, 1=Allow Dumping)
  1024 x 16bit Data ROM/PROM
  256 x 16bit  Data RAM

ROM-Images
DSPn/ST010/ST011 ROM-images consist of the Program ROM followed by the Data
ROM, both stored in big-endian format, optionally including padding bytes after
each 24bit opcode (usually FFh). Ie. 24bit Opcode 123456h would be stored as
12,34,56 or 12,34,56,FF. And 16bit Data word 1234h as 12,34. The big-endian
byte-order & padding-byte are following the format how data is transferred
to/from the uPD77P25 PROM version.
Ideally, the ROM-Image should be attached at the end of the SNES Cartridge
ROM-Image (when doing that, best remove any 200h-byte header, since the
existing headers don't define if/how to adjust their size-entries for
DSPn/ST01n ROMs).

DPH is only 3bit (M0..M7), BRCH is only 8bit (without JDPLN0, JDPLNF opcodes).
Data ROM entries are only 13bit wide (sign-expanded to 16bit... or left-shifted
to 16bit?). NA is only 9bit. Internal clock is only 4MHz. TRB register is not
supported.

SNES Cart DSP-n/ST010/ST011 - NEC uPD77C25 - ALU and LD Instructions
--------------------------------------------------------------------

ALU Instructions (Artithmetic/Logical Unit)
  23    0   Must be 0 for ALU opcodes
  22    RT  Return after ALU (0=No/Normal, 1=Yes/Return from Call/Interrupt)
  21-20 P   ALU input P (0=RAM[DP], 1=IDB(SRC), 2=K*L*2/10000h, 3=K*L*2)
  19-16 ALU ALU opcode
  15    A   ALU input/output Q (0=AccA, 1=AccB)
  14-13 DPL Data RAM Pointer DP.3-0 adjust (0=DPNOP, 1=DPINC, 2=DPDEC, 3=DPCLR)
  12-9  DPH Data RAM Pointer DP.7-4 adjust (0..0Fh=M0..MF) (XOR by that value)
  8     RP  Data ROM Pointer RP.9-0 adjust (0=RPNOP, 1=RPDEC)
  7-4   SRC Source (copied to DST, and, for ALU, to "IDB" internal data bus)
  3-0   DST Destination (copied from SRC)
Allows to combine an ALU operation with memory load & store, DP/RP pointer
adjustment, optional RET from CALL, along with the K*L*2 multiplication.

LD Instructions (Load)
  23    1   Must be 1 for LD opcodes
  22    1   Must be 1 for LD opcodes
  21-6  ID  16bit Immediate
  5-4   -   Reserved (should be zero)
  3-0   DST Destination (copied from ID)
Load is mainly for initialization purposes & other special cases (normally it's
faster load immediates from Data ROM, via SRC=RO in ALU opcodes).

  0Fh XCHG      ;Acc = Acc ROL 8            sf  sf  0   zf 0   0
ADD/ADC/SUB/SBB/INC/DEC set "S1=sf" and "OV1=OV1 XOR 1" upon overflow (and
leave S1 and OV1 both unchanged if no overflow).
OtherCy is the incoming carry flag from other accumulator (ie. Cy from FlagA
when using AccB).
Note: "NOT" is called "CMP"=Complement in official syntax; it isn't Compare.
"SAR/RCL/SLL" are called "SHR/SHL/SHL" in official syntax; though they aren't
"normal" logical shifts. OR/AND/XOR/NOT/SAR/RCL/SLL/XCHG do offially set
S1=Undefined (but actually it seems to be S1=sf; required for loopings in
"Super Air Diver 2"; which uses OR opcode followed by SGN operand).

Multiplier
After each instruction (namely after any ALU and LD instructions that have
changed K or L registers), the hardware computes K*L*2 (signed
16bit*16bit->32bit). Result on overflows (-8000h*-8000h*2) is unknown.

  0Fh   MEM  (RAM[DP])                 @MEM (RAM[DP])
When not using SRC: specify "NON" in source code, and 00h (a dummy TRB fetch)
in binary code.
Following combinations are prohibited in ALU instructions:
  DST field = @KLR or @KLM combined with SRC field = K or L register
  DST field and SRC field specify the same register
  P-SELECT field = RAM, DST field = @MEM (for ALU operation)
Everything else should be allowed (included ALU with SRC=Acc, eg ADD AccA,AccA)

Variants
The older uPD77C20 doesn't support TRB: SRC=00h is NON (=zero/undefined?),
DST=0Eh (and also DST=00h) is @NON. Opcodes are only 23bit wide (strip
ALU.Bit11/MSB of DPH, and LD.Bit5/Reserved).

Jump addresses should be specified 24bit word units (not in byte units).
(*) Opcodes 000h,101h,141h supported on ST010/ST011 only. On that CPU, PC.bit13
can be manipulated by unconditional jump/call/ret (whilst conditional jumps
affect only PC.bit12-0).

Reset (Vector 000h)
Reset is triggered when RST pin is high, and does set PC=000h, FlagA=00h,
FlagB=00h, SR=0000h, DRQ=0, SORQ=0, SI.ACK=0, SO.ACK=0, and RP=3FFh. Other
registers and Data RAM are left unchanged.

Interrupts (Vector 100h)
Interrupts are triggered on raising edge of INT pin. If interrupts are enabled
(in SR register), the CPU jumps to address 100h, and pushes PC on stack, the
interrupts are NOT automatically disabled.

Variants
The older uPD77C20 doesn't support JDPLN0 and JDPLNF. Opcodes are only 23bit
wide (strip JP.Bit13/LSB of BRCH). And PC/NA is only 9bit wide (replace
JP.Bit3-2 by Reserved).

DSP1 Commands
When requesting data from an external device the DSP is oblivious to the type
of operation that occurs to the Data Register. Writing to the Data register
will update the contents of the register and allow the DSP to continue
execution. Reading from the Data Register will also allow the DSP to continue
execution. On completion of a valid command the Data Register should contain
the value 0x80. This is to prevent a valid command from executing should a
device read past the end of output.

ST010 Commands
Commands are executed on the ST-0010 by writing the command to 0x0020 and
setting bit 7 of 0x0021. Bit 7 of 0x0021 will stay set until the Command has
completed, at which time output data will be available. See individual commands
for input and output parameter addresses.

The ST010 BIOS functions are more or less useless and don't increase the
performance or quality of the game (the only feature that is <really> used is
the battery-backed on-chip RAM, aside from that, the powerful chip is a waste
of resources). Note: The ST010 is also used in "Twin Eagle II" (arcade game,
not a SNES game).

SNES Cart Seta ST018 (pre-programmed unknown CPU) (1 game)
----------------------------------------------------------

Seta ST018 - 160pin SETA D6984 ST018 chip (PCB SHVC-1DE3B-01)
The chip is used by a single game only:
  Hayazashi Nidan Morita Shogi 2 (ST018) (1995) Random House/SETA Corp. (JP)
Like the 64pin ST011, it should contain a japanese chess engine (though
possibly different instruction set, reportedly/possibly a NEC RISC CPU).
Note: The ST018 is occassionally referred to as ST0018 (the correct <chip> name
is ST018, the double-zero variant is found on the PCB's text layer).
I/O Ports are at 3800h..3804h and (maybe) also at FF40h..FF63h (the latter ones
might be constants be constants in ROM, or read-only I/O ports; if they are I/O
ports: unknown how that'd affect the ROM-checksum).
  3800h.R  Data (from ST018 to SNES) (when STAT.4=0 and STAT.0=1)
  3802h.W  Data (from SNES to ST018) (when STAT.4=0)
  3802h.R  Ack (dummy read used to acknowledge something)
  3804h.W  Control (00h=Normal, 01h=HardReset, FFh=SoftReset?)

  3 Unknown/Unused
  4 Transfer Request (0=Okay/Ready/RequestDataIn/Out, 1=Fail/Busy/NoRequest)
  5 Unknown/Unused
  6 Ready (0=Busy, 1=Ready) (used only when [FF41]<>00h)
  7 Ready (0=Busy, 1=Ready) (used alongside softreset and hardreset)
ST018 commands
  A3  Debug (send 2 byte bank, 2 byte offset, then receive 128 bytes)
  AA  UploadBoardAndSomethingElse (send 9x9 plus 16 bytes)
  AB  unknown (send 1 byte) (02h) (maybe len for command AD)
  AD  unknown (receive 2 bytes)
  AE  unknown (no parameters)
  AF  unknown (receive 1 byte) (len for command B0)
  B0  unknown (receive LEN bytes) (LEN from command AF)
  B1  unknown (send 2 bytes)
  B2  unknown (send 2 bytes)
  B3  unknown (receive 1 byte)
  B4  unknown (receive 1 byte)
  B5  unknown (receive 1 byte)
  B6  unknown (receive 1 byte)
  F1  Status/Test (if response.bit2=1, receive 2 error bytes)
  F2  Status/Test (if response<>00h, receive 2 error bytes)
  F3  Debug (receive 128Kbytes from 0000:0000..0001:FFFF, for HEX-DUMP display)
  F4  Debug (receive 32Kbytes from A000:0000..A000:7FFF, for HEX-DUMP display)
With the Debug commands, it'd might exceptionally easy to dump the on-chip BIOS
ROM (without needing to decap the chip), but so far nobody seems to have
done/tried to do so (???)

SNES Cart OBC1 (OBJ Controller) (1 game)
----------------------------------------

The OBC1 is a 80pin OBJ Controller chip from Nintendo, used by only one game:
  Metal Combat: Falcon's Revenge (1993) Intelligent Systems/Nintendo
  (Note: the game also requires a Super Scope lightgun)

OBC1 I/O Ports
  7FF0h OAM Xloc = [Base+Index*4+0]  (R/W)
  7FF1h OAM Yloc = [Base+Index*4+1]  (R/W)
  7FF2h OAM Tile = [Base+Index*4+2]  (R/W)
  7FF3h OAM Attr = [Base+Index*4+3]  (R/W)
  7FF4h OAM Bits = [Base+Index/4+200h].Bit((Index AND 3)*2+0..1) (R?/W)
  7FF5h Base for 220h-byte region (bit0: 0=7C00h, 1=7800h)
  7FF6h Index (OBJ Number) (0..127)
  7FF7h Unknown (set to 00h or 0Ah) (maybe SRAM vs I/O mode select)
Other bytes at 6000h..7FFFh contain 8Kbyte battery-backed SRAM (of which,
7800h..7A1Fh and 7C00h..7E1Fh can be used as OBJ workspace).

Notes
Port 7FF0h-7FF3h/7FF5h are totally useless. Port 7FF4h/7FF6h are eventually
making it slightly easier to combine the 2bit OAM fragments, though putting a
huge 80pin chip into the cartridge for merging 2bit fragments is definetly
overcomplicated.
As far as known, the Index isn't automatically incremented. Port 7FF4h does
read-modify-write operations which may involve timing restrictions (?), or,
modify-write (when prefetching data on 7FF6h writes) which may come up with
out-dated-prefetch effects.
Reading from 7FF4h does reportedly return the desired BYTE, but WITHOUT
isolating & shifting the desired BITS into place?
Setting Index bits7+5 does reportedly enable SRAM mapping at 6000h..77FFh?
ROM is reportedly mapped to bank 00h..3Fh, and also to bank 70h..71h? Maybe
that info just refers to SRAM not being mapped to that region (as it'd be in
some other LoROM cartridges).

PCB "SHVC-2E3M-01"
Contains six chips and a battery. The chips are: Two 1MB ROMs, MAD-1, OBC1,
CIC, 8K SRAM. All chips (except MAD-1) are SMD chips.

SNES Cart S-DD1 (Data Decompressor) (2 games)

SNES Cart SPC7110 (Data Decompressor) (3 games)
-----------------------------------------------

The SPC7110 (full name "SPC7110F0A" or "SPC7110Foa") is a 100pin Data
Decompression chip from Epson/Seiko, used only by three games from Hudson soft:
  Far East of Eden Zero (with RTC-4513) (1995) Red Company/Hudson Soft (JP)
  Momotaro Dentetsu Happy (1996) Hudson Soft (JP)
  Super Power League 4 (1996) Hudson Soft (JP)

SNES Cart SPC7110 Memory and I/O Map
------------------------------------

Memory Map
  4800h..4842h      SPC7110 I/O Ports
  6000h..7FFFh      Battery-backed SRAM (8K bytes, in all 3 games)
  8000h..FFFFh      Exception Handlers (Program ROM offset 8000h..FFFFh)

  D00000h..DFFFFFh  Data ROM (1MByte-fragment mapped via Port 4831h)
  E00000h..EFFFFFh  Data ROM (1MByte-fragment mapped via Port 4832h)
  F00000h..FFFFFFh  Data ROM (1MByte-fragment mapped via Port 4833h)
I/O Ports and SRAM are probably mirrored to banks 00h-3Fh and 80h-BFh.
Program/Data ROM is probably mirrored to 400000h-7FFFFFh, the upper 32K
fragments of each 64K bank probably also to banks 00h-3Fh and 80h-BFh.

Reportedly (probably nonsense?)
"data decompressed from data rom by spc7110 mapped to $50:0000-$50:FFFF".
That info would imply that "decompressed data" Port 4800h is mirrored to
500000h-5FFFFFh (though more likely, the "un-decompressed data" is mirrored
from D00000h-DFFFFFh).

ROM-Image Format
The existing SPC7110 games are 2MB, 3MB, 5MB in size. Stored like so:
  000000h..0FFFFFh  Program ROM (1MByte) (HiROM)
  100000h..xFFFFFh  Data ROM (1MByte, 2MByte, or 4MByte max)
Observe that the SPC7110 ROM checksums at [FFDCh..FFDFh] are calculated
unconventionally: 3MB/5MB aren't "rounded-up" to 4MB/8MB. Instead, 3MB is
checksummed twice (rounded to 6MB). 2MB/5MB are checksummed as 2MB/5MB (without
rounding).

4806h - Decompressed Data RAM Target Offset, bit8-15   OFFSET IN BANK $50
Reportedly: Destination address in bank 50h, this would imply that the SPC7110
chip contains around 64Kbytes on-chip RAM, which is probably utmost nonsense.
Or, reportedly, too: Causes the first "N" decompressed bytes to be skipped,
before data shows up at 4800h. That sounds more or less reasonable. If so,
unknown if the hardware does decrement the offset value?

4807h - DMA Channel for Decompression
Unknown. Reportedly "DMA CHANNEL FOR DECOMPRESSION, set to match snes dma
channel used for compressed data". That info seems to be nonsense; the
registers seems to be always set to 00h, no matter if/which DMA channel is
used.

4808h - C r/w option, unknown
Unknown. Reportedly "C r/w option, unknown".

4809h - Decompressed Data Length Counter, bit0-7
480Ah - Decompressed Data Length Counter, bit8-15
This counter is decremented on reads from [4800h]. One can initialize the
counter before decompression & check its value during decompression. However,
this doesn't seem to be required hardware-wise; the decompression seems to be
working endless (as long as software reads [4800h]), and doesn't seem to "stop"
when the length counter becomes zero.

480Bh - Decompression Mode
Reportedly:
  00 - manual decompression, $4800 is used to read directly from the data rom

  02 - hardware decompression, decompressed data is mapped to $50:0000,
       $4800 can be used to read sequentially from bank $50

480Ch - Decompression Status (bit7: 0=Busy/Inactive, 1=Ready/DataAvailable)
Reportedly:
  DECOMPRESSION FINISHED STATUS:
  high bit set = done, high bit clear = processing,
  cleared after successful read,
  high bit is cleared after writing to $4806,
  $4809/A is set to compressed data length
  ---
  decompression mode is activated after writing to $4806
  and finishes after reading the high bit of $480C

SNES Cart SPC7110 Direct Data ROM Access
----------------------------------------

4810h Data ROM Read from [Base] or [Base+Offs], and increase Base or Offs
481Ah Data ROM Read from [Base+Offset], and optionally set Base=Base+Offs
Reportedly,
Testing leads to believe that the direct ROM read section starts out as
inactive.
One of the ways to activate direct reads is to write a non-zero value to $4813.
No other action need be taken. You can write a non-zero value and immediately
write a zero to it and that's OK.  The order of writes to $4811/2/3 don't
seem to matter so long as $4813 has been written to once with a non-zero
value.  There may be a way to deactivate the direct reads again (maybe a
decompression cycle?).
There appears to be another way to activate direct reads that is more complex.

Special Actions:

  2=After Writing $4814/5 --> 16 bit offset addition using $4814/5
  3=After Reading $481A   --> 16 bit offset addition using $4814/5
Reportedly,
  4818 write: set command mode,
  4818 read: performs action instead of returning value, unknown purpose
  command mode is loaded to $4818 but only set after writing to both $4814
  and $4815 in any order
  $4811/2/3 may increment on a $4810 read depending on mode byte)
  $4814/$4815 is sometimes incremented on $4810 reads (depending on mode byte)
Note: the data rom command mode is activated only after registers $4814 and
$4815 have been written to, regardless of the order they were written to

Unknown Stuff
Multiply/Divide execution time is unknown. Is it constant/faster for small
values? Behaviour on Divide by 0 is unknown?
Purpose of 482Eh is unknown, does it really "reset" 4820h..482Dh? Meaning that
those registers are set to zero? Is that required/optional?
Are there other modes, like support for signed-numbers, or a fast 8bit*8bit
multiply mode or such?

SNES Cart SPC7110 with RTC-4513 Real Time Clock (1 game)
--------------------------------------------------------

RTC from Epson/Seiko. Used by one game from Hudson Soft:
  Far East of Eden Zero (with RTC-4513) (1995) Red Company/Hudson Soft (JP)

SPC7110 I/O Ports for RTC-4513 Access
  4840h RTC Chip Select (bit0: 0=Deselect: CE=LOW, 1=Select: CE=HIGH)
  4841h RTC Data Port   (bit0-3: Command/Index/Data)
  4842h RTC Status      (bit7: 1=Ready, 0=Busy) (for 4bit transfers)

Usage
Switch CE from LOW to HIGH, send Command (03h=Write, 0Ch=Read), send starting
Index (00h..0Fh), then read or write one or more 4bit Data units (index will
automatically increment after each access, and wraps from 0Fh to 00h at end of
data stream). Finally, switch CE back LOW.

SNES Cart Unlicensed Variants
-----------------------------

Gamars Puzzle (Kaiser)
A LoROM game with SRAM at 316000h (unlike normal LoROM games that have SRAM at
70xxxxh). Cartridge Header Maker entry is [FFDAh]=00h, and SRAM size entry is
[FFD8h]=20h (4096 gigabytes), the actual size of the SRAM is unknown.

SNES Cart S-RTC (Realtime Clock) (1 game)
-----------------------------------------

PCB "SHVC-LJ3R-01" with 24pin "Sharp S-RTC" chip. Used only by one japanese
game:
  Dai Kaiju Monogatari 2 (1996) Birthday/Hudson Soft (JP)

S-RTC I/O Ports
  002800h S-RTC Read  (R)
  002801h S-RTC Write (W)
Both registers are 4bits wide. When writing: Upper 4bit should be zero. When
reading: Upper 4bit should be masked-off (they do possibly contain garbage, eg.
open-bus).

S-RTC Communication
The sequence for setting, and then reading the time is:
  Send <0Eh,04h,0Dh,0Eh,00h,Timestamp(12 digits),0Dh> to [002801h]
  If ([002800h] AND 0F)=0Fh then read <Timestamp(13 digits)>
  If ([002800h] AND 0F)=0Fh then read <Timestamp(13 digits)>
  If ([002800h] AND 0F)=0Fh then read <Timestamp(13 digits)>
  If ([002800h] AND 0F)=0Fh then read <Timestamp(13 digits)>
  etc.
The exact meaning of the bytes is unknown. 0Eh/0Dh seems to invoke/terminate
commands, 04h might be some configuration stuff (like setting 24-hour mode).
00h is apparently the set-time command. There might be further commands (such
like setting interrupts, alarm, 12-hour mode, reading battery low & error
flags, etc.). When reading, 0Fh seems to indicate sth like "time available".
The 12/13-digit "SSMMHHDDMYYY(D)" Timestamps are having the following format:
  Seconds.lo  (BCD, 0..9)
  Seconds.hi  (BCD, 0..5)
  Minutes.lo  (BCD, 0..9)
  Minutes.hi  (BCD, 0..5)
  Hours.lo    (BCD, 0..9)
  Hours.hi    (BCD, 0..2)
  Day.lo      (BCD, 0..9)
  Day.hi      (BCD, 0..3)
  Month       (HEX, 01h..0Ch)
  Year.lo     (BCD, 0..9)
  Year.hi     (BCD, 0..9)
  Century     (HEX, 09h..0Ah for 19xx..20xx)
When READING the time, there is one final extra digit (the existing software
doesn't transmit that extra digit on WRITING, though maybe it's possible to do
writing, too):
  Day of Week? (0..6) (unknown if RTC assigns sth like 0=Sunday or 0=Monday)

SNES Cart Super Gameboy
-----------------------

The Super Gameboy (SGB) is some kind of an adaptor for monochrome handheld
Gameboy games. The SGB cartridge contains a fully featured gameboy (with CPU,
Video & Audio controllers), but without LCD screen and without joypad buttons.
The 4-grayshade 160x144 pixel video signal is forwarded to SNES VRAM and shown
on TV Set, and in the other direction, the SNES joypad data is forwarded to SGB
CPU.
Some gameboy games include additional SGB features, allowing to display a
256x224 pixel border that surrounds the 160x144 pixel screen, there are also
some (rather limited) functions for colorizing the monochrome screen, plus some
special Sound, OBJ, Joypad functions. Finally, the gameboy game can upload
program code to the SNES and execute it.

  ICD2-R (or ICD2-N) - 44pin - Super Gameboy SGB-to-SNES Interface Chip
Plus VRAM/WRAM for SGB CPU, plus SNES SGB BIOS, plus CIC chip.

SGB I/O Map (ICD2-R)
  6000       R  LCD Character Row and Buffer Write-Row
  6001       W  Character Buffer Read Row Select
  6002       R  16-Byte Packet Available Flag
  6003       W  Reset/Multiplayer/Speed Control
  6004-6007  W  Controller Data for Player 1-4
  6008-600E  -  Unused (Open Bus)
  600F       R  Value 61h (not open bus)
  6800-680F  -  Unused (Open Bus)
  7000-700F  R  16-byte command packet (addr 7000..700F)
  7800       R  Character Buffer Data (320 bytes of currently selected row)
  7801-780F  R  Unused (Mirrors of 7800h, not Open Bus)
The ICD2 chips decodes only A0-A3,A11-A15,A22 (so above is mirrored to various
addresses at xx6xxN/xx7xxN). Reading the Unused registers (and write-only ones)
returns CPU Open Bus values (though, for some reason, usually with bit3=1).

SGB Port 6000h - LCD Character Row and Buffer Write-Row (R)
  7-3  Current Character Row on Gameboy LCD (0..11h) (11h=Last Row, or Vblank)
  2    Seems to be always zero
  1-0  Current Character Row Write Buffer Number (0..3)

SGB Port 6001h - Character Buffer Read Row Select (W)
  7-2  Unknown/unused      (should be zero)
  1-0  Select Character Row READ Buffer Number (0..3)
Selects one of the four buffer rows (for reading via Port 7800h). Only the
three "old" buffers should be selected, ie. not the currently written row
(which is indicated in 6000h.Bit1-0).

SGB Port 6002h - 16-Byte Packet Available Flag (R)
  7-1  Seems to be always zero
  0    New 16-byte Packet Available (0=None, 1=Yes)
When set, a 16-byte SGB command packet can be read from 7000h-700Fh; of which,
reading 7000h does reset the flag in 6002h.

SGB Port 6003h - Reset/Multiplayer/Speed Control (W)
  7    Reset Gameboy CPU   (0=Reset, 1=Normal)
  6    Unknown/unused      (should be zero)
  5-4  num_controllers     (0,1,3=One,Two,Four)  (default 0=One Player)
  3-2  Unknown/unused      (should be zero)
  1-0  SGB CPU Speed       (0..3 = 5MHz,4MHz,3MHz,2.3MHz) (default 1=4MHz)
The LSBs select the SGB CPU Speed (the SNES 21MHz master clock divided by
4,5,7,9). Unknown if/how/when the SGB BIOS does use this. For the SGB, the
exact master clock depends on the console (PAL or NTSC). For the SGB2 it's
derived from a separate 20.9MHz oscillator.

SGB Port 6004h-6007h - Controller Data for Player 1-4 (W)
  7    Start     (0=Pressed, 1=Released)
  6    Select    (0=Pressed, 1=Released)
  5    Button B  (0=Pressed, 1=Released)
  4    Button A  (0=Pressed, 1=Released)
  3    Down      (0=Pressed, 1=Released)
  2    Up        (0=Pressed, 1=Released)
  1    Left      (0=Pressed, 1=Released)
  0    Right     (0=Pressed, 1=Released)
Used to forward SNES controller data to the gameboy Joypad inputs. Ports
6005h-6007h are used only in 2-4 player mode (which can be activated via 6003h;
in practice: this can be requested by SGB games via MLT_REQ (command 11h), see
SGB section in Pan Docs for details).

SGB Port 600Fh - Value 61h (R)
  7-0  Seems to be always 61h (on ICD2-R at least) (maybe else on ICD2-N ?)
Maybe indicating a ICD2 Chip ID/version value. The SGB BIOS doesn't use this
register.

SGB Port 7000h-700Fh - 16-byte Command Packet (R)
  7-0  Data
Reading from 7000h (but not from 7001h-700Fh) does reset the flag in 6002h
Aside from regular SGB commands, the SGB BIOS (that in the SGB CPU chip) does
transfer six special packets upon Reset; these do contain gameboy cartridge
header bytes 104h..14Fh (ie. Nintendo Logo, Title, ROM/RAM Size, SGB-Enable
bytes, etc).

SGB Port 7800h - Character Buffer Data (R)
  7-0  Data (320 bytes; from Buffer Row number selected in Port 6001h)
This port should be used as fixed DMA source address for transferring 320 bytes
(one 160x8 pixel character row) to WRAM (and, once when the SNES is in Vblank,
the whole 160x144 pixels can be DMAed from WRAM to VRAM).
The ICD2 chip does automatically re-arrange the pixel color signals (LD0/LD1)
back to 8x8 pixel tiles with two bit-planes (ie. to the same format as used in
Gameboy and SNES VRAM).
The buffer index (0..511) is reset to 0 upon writing to Port 6001h, and is
automatically incremented on reading 7800h. When reading more than 320 bytes,
indices 320..511 return FFh bytes (black pixels), and, after 512 bytes, it
wraps to index 0 within the same buffer row.

Gameboy Audio
The stereo Gameboy Audio Output is fed to the External Audio Input on SNES
cartridge port, so sound is automatically forwarded to the TV Set, ie. software
doesn't need to process sound data (however, mind that the /MUTE signal of the
SNES APU must be released).

SGB Commands
Above describes only the SNES side of the Super Gameboy. For the Gameboy side
(ie. for info on sending SGB packets, etc), see SGB section in Pan Docs:
  http://nocash.emubase.de/pandocs.htm
  http://nocash.emubase.de/pandocs.txt
Some details that aren't described in (current) Pan Docs:
 * JUMP does always destroy the NMI vector (even if it's 000000h)
 * (The SGB BIOS doesn't seem to use NMIs, so destroying it doesn't harm)
 * JUMP can return via 16bit retadr (but needs to force program bank 00h)
 * After JUMP, all RAM can be used, except [0000BBh..0000BDh] (=NMI vector)
 * The IRQ/COP/BRK vectors/handlers are in ROM, ie. only NMIs can be hooked
 * APU Boot-ROM can be executed via MOV [2140h],FEh (but Echo-Write is kept on)
 * The TEST_EN command points to a RET opcode (ie. it isn't implemented)
 * Upon RESET, six packets with gameboy cart header are sent by gameboy bios
 * command 19h does allow to change an undoc flag (maybe palette related?)
 * command 1Ah..1Fh point to RET (no function) (except 1Eh = boot info)
 * sgb cpu speed can be changed (unknown if/how supported by sgb bios)

Note
There is a special controller, the SGB Commander (from Hori), which does
reportedly have special buttons for changing the CPU speed - unknown how it is
doing that (ie. unknown what data and/or ID bits it is transferring to the SNES
controller port).
Probably done by sending button sequences (works also with normal joypad):

SNES Cart Satellaview I/O Receiver Data Streams
-----------------------------------------------

The receiver can be programmed to watch (and receive) two different Hardware
Channels simultaneously. In practice, Stream 1 is used only by the BIOS, and
Stream 2 is used only by a few BS FLASH games (Dragon Quest 1, Satella2 1, BS
Fire Emblem Akaneia Senki 1, and maybe some others) (which do use it for
receiving Time Channel Packets).

2188h/2189h Stream 1 Hardware Channel Number, Lsb/Msb (R/W)
218Eh/218Fh Stream 2 Hardware Channel Number, Lsb/Msb (R/W)
  0-15  Hardware Channel Number (16bit)
Values written to these registers should be taken from the Channel Map packet
(or for receiving the Channel Map itself, use fixed value 0124h). Be sure to
reset the Queues after changing the channel number (so you won't receive old
data from old channel).

218Ah Stream 1 Queue Size (number of received 1+22 byte Units) (R)
2190h Stream 2 Queue Size (number of received 1+22 byte Units) (R)
  0-6  Number of received Units contained in the Queue (0..127)
  7    Overrun Error Flag (set when received more than 127 units)
Indicates how many frames are in the queues. One doesn't need to process all
frames at once; when reading only a few frames, the Queue Size is decremented
accordingly, and the remaining frames stay in the Queue so they can be
processed at a later time. The decrement occurs either after reading 1 byte
from the Status Queue, or after reading 22 bytes from the Data Queue (anyways,
to keep the queues in sync, one should always read the same amount of 1/22-byte
Units from both Queues, so it doesn't matter when the decrement occurs).

218Bh Stream 1 Queue 1-byte Status Units (Read=Data, Write=Reset)
2191h Stream 2 Queue 1-byte Status Unit(s?) (Read=Data, Write=Reset)
Contains Header/Data Start/End flags for the received Data Frames, the format
seems to be same as for Port 218Dh/2193h (see there for details) (if it's
really same, then the two Error bits should be also contained in the Status
Queue, though the BIOS doesn't use them in that place).

218Ch Stream 1 Queue 22-byte Data Units (Read=Data, Write=Reset/Ack)
2192h Stream 2 Queue 22-byte? Data Unit(s?) (Read=Data, Write=Reset/Ack)
Contains the received Data Frames, or in case of Header Frames: The 5/10-byte
Frame Header, followed by the Packet/Fragment Header, followed by the actual
Data.

218Dh Stream 1 Status Summary (R)
2193h Stream 2 Status Summary (R)
These registers seem to contain a summary of the Status bytes being most
recently removed from the Queue. Ie. status bits are probably getting set by
ORing all values being read from Port 218Ah/2190h. The bits are probably
cleared after reading 218Dh/2193h.
  0-1  Unknown/unused
  2-3  Error Flags (probably set on checksum errors or lost data/timeouts)
  4    Packet Start Flag (0=Normal, 1=First Frame of Packet) (with Header)
  5-6  Unknown/unused
  7    Packet End Flag   (0=Normal, 1=Last Frame of Packet)
Bit 2-3 are more or less self-explaining: Don't use the queued data, and
discard any already (but still incompletely) received packet fragments. Bit 4,7
are a bit more complicated. See Notes in next chapter for details.
--> SNES Cart Satellaview I/O Receiver Data Streams (Notes)

SNES Cart Satellaview I/O Receiver Data Streams (Notes)
-------------------------------------------------------

Resetting the Queues
Clearing the Status & Data Queues is needed on power-up, after Overrun, or
after changing the Hardware Channel number. The procedure is:
  MOV A,01h     ;\
  MOV [218Bh],A ; must be executed in FAST memory (at 3.58MHz) (otherwise the
  NOP           ; the Status Queue may be not in sync with the Data Queue)
  NOP           ; (for Stream 2 do the same with Port 2192h/2193h accordingly,
  NOP           ; though the existing games that do use Stream 2 are including
  NOP           ; several near-excessive timing bugs in that section)
  MOV [218Ch],A ;/
Thereafter, Status & Data queue are empty, and the Queue Size register is 00h
(both 7bit counter, and Overrun flag cleared).

Reading the Queues
  N=[218Ah]                                      ;-get queue size
  if N=0 then exit                               ;-exit if no data in queues
  if N.Bit7=1 then reset_queue/abort_packet/exit ;-handle overrun error
  N=max(20,N)                                    ;-limit to max 20 (if desired)
  for i=0 to (N-1), stat[i]=[219Bh], next        ;-read status units
  stat_summary=[219Dh]                           ;-get status summary
  for i=0 to (N*22-1), data[i]=[219Ch], next     ;-read data units

Channel Disable
After receiving a full packet, the BIOS issues a "MOV [218Ch],00h", this might
acknowledge something, or (more probably) disable the Channel so that no new
data is added to the Queue. The mechanism for re-enabling the channel is
unknown (prossibly resetting the Queue, or writing the Channel register). For
Stream 2, "MOV [2192h],00h" should do the same thing.

Overrun Notes
Overrun means that one hasn't processed the queues fast enough. If so, one
should Reset the queues and discard any already-received incomplete packet
fragments. There seems to be no problem if an overrun occurs WHILE reading from
the queue (ie. overrun seems to stop adding data to the queue, rather than
overwriting the old queued data) (of course AFTER reading the queue, one will
need to handle the overrun, ie. discard all newer data).
Note: Stream 1 can queue 127 frames (presumably plus 1 incomplete frame, being
currently received). As far as known, Stream 2 is used only for Time Channels
(with single-frame packets), so it's unknown if Stream 2 is having the same
queue size.

Packet Start/End Flags
The status queue values (with start/end bits isolated) would be:
  90h               ;packet is 1 frame  (10-byte header + 12-byte data)
  10h,80h           ;packet is 2 frames (10-byte header + 34-byte data)
  10h,00h,80h       ;packet is 3 frames (10-byte header + 56-byte data)
  10h,00h,00h,80h   ;packet is 4 frames (10-byte header + 78-byte data)
and so on. For Channel Map, header is only 5-byte, and data is 5 bigger.

Caution: After having received the header (ie. at time when receiving the
data), the BIOS treats the Header-Start Flag in the Status Summary register (!)
as Error-Flag, to some point that makes sense in the Data-phase, but it will
cause an error if a new header frame is received shortly AFTER the Data-phase.
As a workaround, the transmitter should not send new Packet Fragments (on the
same Hardware Channel) for at least 1/60 seconds (preferably longer, say 1/20
seconds) after the end of the last Data Frame.

Transfer Rate
The transfer rate is unknown. Aside from the actual transmission speed, the
effective download rate will also depend on how often data is transmitted on a
specific channel (there are probably pauses between packet fragments, and maybe
also between 22-byte frames), this may vary depening on how many other packets
are transmitted, and how much priority is given to individual packets.
The download rate is slow enough for allowing the BIOS to write incoming data
directly to FLASH memory. Moreover, the BIOS Vblank NMI Handler processes only
max twenty 22-byte frames per 60Hz PPU frame. Knowing that, the download rate
must be definetly below 26400 bytes/second (20*22*60).
As far as known, the Satellaview broadcasts replaced former St.GIGA radio
broadcasts, assuming that the radio used uncompressed CD quality (2x16bit at
44.1kHz), and assuming that Satellaview used the same amount of data, the
transfer rate may have been 176400 bytes/second (which could have been divided
to transfer 8 different packets at 22050 bytes/second, for example).

SNES Cart Satellaview I/O Receiver Control
------------------------------------------

2194h POWER (bit0) and ACCESS (bit2-3) LED Control? (R/W)
  0   Usually set  <-- is ZERO by Itoi (maybe POWER LED)
  1   Usually zero <-- is SET by Itoi  (maybe 2nd-color of Power LED)
  2-3 Usually both set or both cleared (maybe ACCESS LED)
  4-7 Usually zero
Bit2/3 are toggled by software when writing to FLASH memory. Bit0 is usually
set. Might control the POWER and ACCESS LEDs on the Satellaview's Front Panel
(assuming that the LEDs are software controlled). Using other values than
listed above might change the LED color (assuming they are two-color LEDs).

2195h Unknown/Unused, maybe for EXT Expansion Port (?)
This register isn't used by the BIOS, nor by any games. Maybe it does allow to
input/output data to the Satellaview's EXT Port.

2196h Status (only bit1 is tested) (R)
  0    Unknown/unused
  1    Status (0=Okay, 1=Malfunction)
  2-7  Unknown/unused
Tested shortly after the overall hardware detection, and also during NMI
handling. Probably indicates some kind of fundamental problem (like low supply
voltage, missing EXPAND-Pin connection in cartridge, or no Satellite Tuner
connected).

2197h Control (only bit7 is modified) (R/W)
  0-6  Unknown/unused (should be left unchanged)
  7    Power Down Mode? (0=Power Down, 1=Operate/Normal)
Bit7 is set by various BIOS functions, and, notably: When [7FD9h/FFD9h].Bit4
(in Satellaview FLASH File Header) is set. Also notably: Bit7 is set/cleared
depending on Town Status Entry[07h].Bit6-7.

2198h Serial I/O Port 1 (R/W)
2199h Serial I/O Port 2 (R/W)
These ports are basically 3-bit parallel ports, which can be used as three-wire
serial ports (with clock, data.in, data.out lines) (by doing the "serial"
transfer by software). Outgoing data must be written before toggling clock,
incoming data can be read thereafter.
  0    Clock (must be manually toggled per data bit)
  1-5  Unknown/unused (should be 0)
  6    Chip Select - For Port 1: 1=Select / For Port 2: 0=Select
  7    Data (Write=Data.Out, Read=Data.in) (data-in is directly poll-able)
Bits are transferred MSB first.
Unknown which chips these ports are connected to. One port does most probably
connect to the 64pin MN88821 chip (which should do have a serial port; assuming
that it is a MN88831 variant). The other port <might> connect to the small 8pin
SPR-BSA chip?
Possible purposes might be configuration/calibration, Audio volume control, and
Audio channel selection (assuming that the hardware can decode audio data and
inject it to SNES Expansion Port sound inputs).

Serial Port 1 (2198h)
The BIOS contains several functions for sending multi-byte data to, and
receiving 16bit-units from this port. Though the functions seem to be left
unused? (at least, they aren't used in the low-level portion in first 32K of
the BIOS).
Port 1 specific notes: When reading (without sending), the outgoing dummy-bits
should be set to all zero. Chip is selected when Bit6=1. Aside from receiving
data from bit7, that bit is also polled in some cases for sensing if the chip
is ready (0=Busy, 1=Ready).

Serial Port 2 (2199h)
Data written to this port consists of simple 2-byte pairs (index-byte,
data-byte), apparently to configure some 8bit registers. Used values are:
  Reg[0] = 88h (or 00h when Power-Down?) (soundlink on/off?)
  Reg[1] = 80h
  Reg[2] = 04h
  Reg[3] = 00h
  Reg[4] = 08h
  Reg[5] = 00h
  Reg[6] = 70h
  Reg[7] = Not used
  Reg[8] = 00h
  Reg[9..FF] = Not used
There are also BIOS functions for reading 1-byte or 3-bytes from this Port, but
they seem to be left unused (but, BS Dragon Quest, and Itoi are doing 24bit
reads via direct I/O, whereas Itoi wants the 1st bit to be 0=ready/okay).
Port 2 specific notes: When reading (without sending), the outgoing dummy-bits
should be set to all ones. Chip(-writing) is selected when Bit6=0.

SNES Cart Satellaview I/O FLASH Detection (Type 1,2,3,4)
--------------------------------------------------------

The Satellaview FLASH cartridges contain slightly customized "standard" FLASH
chips; with a Nintendo-specific Chip Detection sequence:

Detection Sequence
  [C00000h]=38h, [C00000h]=D0h                  ;request chip info part 1
  delay (push/pop A, three times each)          ;delay
  [C00000h]=71h                                 ;enter status mode
  repeat, X=[C00002h], until (X.bit7=1)         ;wait until ready
  [C00000h]=72h, [C00000h]=75h                  ;request chip info part 2
  FOR i=0 to 9, info[i]=BYTE[C0FF00h+i*2], NEXT ;read chip info (10 bytes)
  [C00000h]=FFh                                 ;terminate status mode
BUG: For Type 2 chips, one <should> probably use "[C05555h]=AAh, [C02AAAh]=55h,
[C05555h]=F0h" instead of "[C00000h]=FFh" (the BIOS is actually <trying> to do
that, but it's doing that before it has deciphired the Type bits).

Detection Values
  info[0] - ID1 (Must be "M" aka 4Dh)
  info[1] - ID2 (Must be "P" aka 50h)
  info[2] - Flags (Must be bit7=0 and bit0=0) (other bits unknown)
  info[3] - Device Info (upper 4bit=Type, lower 4bit=Size)
  info[4..9] - Unknown/Unused (BIOS copies them to RAM, but doesn't use them)
Type must be 01h..04h for Type 1-4 accordingly. Size must be 07h..0Ch for
128Kbyte, 256Kbyte, 512Kbyte, 1Mbyte, 2Mbyte, 4Mbyte accordingly (ie. 1 SHL N
Kbytes).

Rejected Values
Wrong ID1/ID2 or wrong Flag Bit7/Bit0 are rejected. Type 00h or 05h..0Fh are
rejected. Size 00h..05h is rejected. Size 06h would be a half 128Kbyte block,
which is rounded-down to 0 blocks by the BIOS. Size 0Dh would exceed the 32bit
block allocation flags in header entry 7FD0h/FFD0h. Size 0Fh would additionally
exceed the 8bit size number.

Special Cases
If no FLASH cartridge is inserted, then the detection does probably rely on
open bus values, ie. "MOV A,[C00002h]" probably needs to return C0h (the last
opcode byte) which has bit7=1, otherwise the detection wait-loop would hang
forever.
There are reportedly some "write-protected" cartridges. Unknown what that
means, ROM-cartridges, or FLASH-cartridges with some (or ALL) sectors being
write-protected. And unknown what detection values they do return.

FLASH Base Address
The Satellaview BIOS always uses C00000h as Base Address when writing commands
to FLASH, the MCC chip could be programmed to mirror FLASH to other locations
(although unknown if they are write-able, if so, commands could be also written
to that mirrors).
Game Cartridges with built-in FLASH cartridge slot may map FLASH to other
locations than C00000h, details on that games are unknown. The game carts don't
include MCC chips, but other mapping hardware: In at least some of them the
mapping seems to be controlled by a SA-1 chip (an external 10.74MHz 65C816 CPU
with on-chip I/O ports, including memory-mapping facilities), the SA-1 doesn't
seem to have FLASH-specific mapping registers, so the FLASH might be mapped as
secondary ROM-chip. There may be also other games without SA-1, using different
FLASH mapping mechanism(s)? For some details, see:
--> SNES Cart Data Pack Slots (satellaview-like mini-cartridge slot)

General Notes
FLASH erase sets all bytes to FFh. FLASH writes can only change bits from 1 to
0. Thus, one must normally erase before writing (exceptions are, for example,
clearing the "Limited-Start" bits in Satellaview file header). Type 2 can write
128 bytes at once (when writing less bytes, the other bytes in that area are
left unchanged). The status/detection values may be mirrored to various
addresses; the normal FLASH memory may be unavailable during
write/erase/detection (ie. don't try to access FLASH memory, or even to execute
program code in it, during that operations).

SNES Cart Satellaview I/O FLASH Access (Type 1,3,4)
---------------------------------------------------

The Type 1,3,4 protocol is somewhat compatible to Sharp LH28F032SU/LH28F320SK
chips (which has also a same/similar 52pin package). Concerning the commands
used by the BIOS, Type 1,3,4 seems to be exactly the same - expect that Type 3
doesn't support the Erase-Entire chip command.

Erase Entire Chip (Type 1 and 4 only) (not supported by Type 3)
  [C00000h]=50h                                 ;clear status register
  [C00000h]=71h                                 ;enter status mode
  repeat, X=[C00004h], until (X.bit3=0)         ;wait until VPP voltage okay
  [C00000h]=A7h  ;"erase all unlocked pages"?   ;select erase entire-chip mode
  [C00000h]=D0h                                 ;start erase
  [C00000h]=71h                                 ;enter status mode
  repeat, X=[C00004h], until (X.bit7=1)         ;wait until ready
  if (X.bit5=1) then set erase error flag       ;check if erase error
  [C00000h]=FFh                                 ;terminate status mode

Unknown Command
Same as Erase Entire (see above), but using 97h instead of A7h, and implemented
ONLY for Type 1 and 4, that is: NOT supported (nor simulated by other commands)
for neither Type 2 nor Type 3. Maybe A7h erases only unlocked pages, and 97h
tries to erase all pages (and fails if some are locked?).

Erase 64KByte Sector
  [C00000h]=50h                                 ;clear status register
  [C00000h]=20h                                 ;select erase sector mode
  [nn0000h]=D0h                                 ;start erase 64K bank nn
  [C00000h]=70h                                 ;enter status mode
  repeat, X=[C00000h], until (X.bit7=1)         ;wait until ready
 ;; if (X.bit5=1) then set erase error flag       ;check if erase error
  [C00000h]=FFh                                 ;terminate status mode

Write Data
  FOR i=first to last
    [C00000h]=10h                               ;write byte command
    [nnnnnnh+i]=data[i]                         ;write one data byte
    [C00000h]=70h                               ;enter status mode
    repeat, X=[C00000h], until (X.bit7=1)       ;wait until ready
  NEXT i
  [C00000h]=70h                                 ;enter status mode
  repeat, X=[C00000h], until (X.bit7=1)         ;hmmm, wait again
  if (X.bit4=1) then set write error flag       ;check if write error
  [C00000h]=FFh                                 ;terminate status mode

Enter Erase-Status Mode
  [C00000h]=71h                                 ;enter status mode
  X=[C00004h]                                   ;read status byte
  IF (X.bit7=0) THEN busy
  IF (X.bit3=1) THEN not-yet-ready-to-erase (VPP voltage low)
  IF (X.bit7=1) AND (X.bit5=0) THEN ready/okay
  IF (X.bit7=1) AND (X.bit5=1) THEN erase error ?

Enter Other-Status Mode
  [C00000h]=70h                                 ;enter status mode

Terminate Command
  [C00000h]=FFh                                 ;terminate
Used to leave status or chip-detection mode.

BUGs: On Type 3 chips, the BIOS tries to simulate the "Erase-Entire" command by
issuing multiple "Erase-Sector" command, the bug there is that it tests bit4 of
the flash_size in 128Kbyte blocks (rather than bit4 of the flash_status) as
erase-error flag (see 80BED2h); in practice, that means that the erase-entire
will always fail on 2MByte chips (and always pass okay on all other chips);
whereas, erase-entire is used when downloading files (except for small files
that can be downloaded or relocated to PSRAM).

SNES Cart Satellaview I/O FLASH Access (Type 2)
-----------------------------------------------

Type 2 protocol is completely different as for Type 1,3,4 (aside from the Chip
Detection sequence, which is same for all types).

Erase Entire Chip
  [C05555h]=AAh, [C02AAAh]=55h, [C05555h]=80h   ;unlock erase
  [C05555h]=AAh, [C02AAAh]=55h, [C05555h]=10h   ;do erase entire chip
  [C05555h]=AAh, [C02AAAh]=55h, [C05555h]=70h   ;enter status mode
  repeat, X=[C05555h], until (X.bit7=1)         ;wait until ready
  if (X.bit5=1) then set erase error flag       ;check if erase error
  [C05555h]=AAh, [C02AAAh]=55h, [C05555h]=F0h   ;terminate status mode

Erase 64KByte Sector
  [C00000h]=50h                                 ;huh? (maybe a BIOS bug)
  [C05555h]=AAh, [C02AAAh]=55h, [C05555h]=80h   ;unlock erase
  [C05555h]=AAh, [C02AAAh]=55h, [nn0000h]=30h   ;do erase bank nn
  repeat, X=[C05555h], until (X.bit7=1)         ;wait until ready
  if (X.bit5=1) then set erase error flag       ;check if erase error
  [C05555h]=AAh, [C02AAAh]=55h, [C05555h]=F0h   ;terminate status mode

Write 1..128 Bytes (within a 128-byte boundary)
  [C05555h]=AAh, [C02AAAh]=55h, [C05555h]=A0h   ;enter write mode
  FOR i=first to last, [nnnnnn+i]=data[i]       ;write 1..128 byte(s)
  [nnnnnn+last]=DATA[last]   ;write LAST AGAIN  ;start write operation
  [C05555h]=AAh, [C02AAAh]=55h, [C05555h]=70h   ;enter status mode
  repeat, X=[C05555h], until (X.bit7=1)         ;wait until ready
  [C05555h]=AAh, [C02AAAh]=55h, [C05555h]=F0h   ;terminate status mode

Enter Status Mode
  [C05555h]=AAh, [C02AAAh]=55h, [C05555h]=70h   ;enter status mode
  X=[C05555h]                                   ;read status byte
  IF (X.bit7=0) THEN busy
  IF (X.bit7=1) AND (X.bit5=0) THEN ready/okay
  IF (X.bit7=1) AND (X.bit5=1) THEN ready/erase error ?

Terminate Command
  [C05555h]=AAh, [C02AAAh]=55h, [C05555h]=F0h   ;terminate
Used to leave status or chip-detection mode.

Bugged Commands
The are some cases (BIOS addresses 80BF88h, 80DBA4h, 80E0D5h) where Type 2
programming is mixed up with some non-Type-2 commands (setting [C00000h]=50h
and [C00000h]=FFh), these commands are probably ignored by chip (or switching
it back default mode).

SNES Cart Satellaview Packet Headers and Frames
-----------------------------------------------

Packet Fragment Format (10-byte header)
  00h 1    Transmission ID (in upper 4bit) (must stay same for all fragments)
  01h 1    Current Fragment Number (in lower 7bit)
  02h 3    Fragment Size (N) (big-endian) (excluding first 5 bytes at [00..04])
  05h 1    Fixed, Must be 01h
  06h 1    Total Number of Fragments (00h=Infinite Streaming?)
  07h 3    Target Offset (big-endian) (location of fragment within whole file)
  0Ah N-5  Data Body (first 12 bytes located directly in header frame)
  ... ...  Unused/Padding (until begin of next 22-byte Frame)
This is the normal format used by all packets (except Channel Map packet).

Channel Map Packet Format (5-byte header)
  00h 1    Unknown/unused (would be 4bit Transmission ID for normal packets)
  01h 1    Unknown/unused (would be 7bit Fragment Number for normal packets)
  02h 3    Packet Size (N) (big-endian) (excluding first 5 bytes at [00..04])
  05h N    Data Body (first 17 bytes located directly in header frame)
  ... ...  Unused/Padding (until begin of next 22-byte Frame)

Frames (22-bytes)
Packets are divided into one or more 22-byte frames.
For each frame, a 1-byte status info can be read from Port 218Bh/2191h, the
status contains error flags (indicating bad checksums or lost-frames or so),
and header flags (indicating begin/end of header/data or so).
The 22-byte frame data can be read from Port 218Ch/2192h. If it is header
frame, then its first 10 (or 5) bytes contain the header (as described above),
and the remaining 12 (or 17) bytes are data. If it is a data frame, then all 22
bytes are plain data.

Fragmented Packets
A packet can consist of 1..128 fragments. The packet transmission is repeated
several times (say, for one hour). If it is consisting of several fragments,
one can start downloading anywhere, eg. with the middle fragment, and one can
keep downloading even if some fragments had transmission errors (in both cases,
one must download the missing fragments in the next pass(es) when the
transmission is repeated).
Software should maintain a list of fragments that are already received (if a
fragment is already received: just remove it from the queue without writing to
target area; both for saving CPU load, and for avoiding to destroy previously
received packets in case of transmission errors).
At some time (say, after an hour), transmission of the packet will end, and a
different packet may be transferred on the same hardware channel. Verify the
4bit Transmission ID to avoid mixing up fragments from the old (desired) file
with the new file. Ideally, that ID <should> be stored in the Channel Map or
Directory (this may actually be so), however, the Satellaview BIOS simply takes
the ID from the first received Fragment, and then compares it against following
Fragments (if the ID changed shortly after checking the Directory, and before
receiving the first fragment, then the BIOS will download a "wrong" file).

Fragment Size Bug
The Satellaview BIOS supports only 16bit fragment sizes, it does try to handle
24bit sizes, but if the fragment size exceeds 65535 then it does receive only
the first few bytes, and then treats the whole fragment as "fully" received.

Text Strings
Text strings (file/folder names and descriptions) can contain ASCII (and
presumably JIS and SHIFT-JIS), and following specials:
  00h        End of Line (or return from a "\s" Sub-String)
  0Dh        Carriage Return Line Feed (in descriptions)
  20h..7Eh   ASCII 6pix characters (unlike SHIFT-JIS 12pix ones)
  80h..9Fh   Prefixes for double-byte characters (SHIFT-JIS)
  A0h..DFh   Japanese single-byte characters (JIS or so)
  E0h..EAh   Prefixes for double-byte characters (SHIFT-JIS)
  F0h        Prefix for Symbols (40h..51h:Music-Note,Heart,Dots,Faces,MaKenji)
  "\\"           Yen symbol (unlike ASCII, not a backslash)
  "\b0".."\b3"   Insert Username/Money/Gender/NumItems (12pix SHIFT-JIS)
  "\c0".."\c5"   Changes color or palette or so
  "\d#",p24bit   Insert 16bit Decimal at [p24bit] using 6pix-font
  "\D#",p24bit   Insert 16bit Decimal at [p24bit] using 12pix-font
  "\du#",v24bit  Insert 16bit Decimal Interpreter-Variable using 6pix-font
  "\Du#",v24bit  Insert 16bit Decimal Interpreter-Variable using 12pix-font
                    # = 00     Variable width (no leading spaces/zeroes)
                    # = 1..6   Width 1..6 chars (with leading spaces)
                    # = 01..06 Width 1..6 chars (with leading zeroes)
  "\s",ptr24bit  Insert Sub-string (don't nest with further "\s,\d,\D")
  "\g",ptr24bit  Insert Custom Graphics/Symbol (ptr to xsiz,ysiz,bitmap)
  "\i"           Carriage Return (set x=0, keep y=unchanged) (not so useful)
  "\m0".."\m3"   Flags (bit0=ForceHorizontal16pixGrid, bit1=DonNotUpdateBg3Yet)
  "\n"           Carriage Return Line Feed (same as 0Dh)
  "\p00".."\p07" Palette
  "\w00".."\w99" Character Delay in Frames (00=None)
  "\x00".."\xNN" Set Xloc
  "\y00".."\yNN" Set Yloc
Note: "\m","\p","\w","\x","\y" are slightly bugged (causing stack overflows
when using them too often within a single string; the text output thread quits
at the string-end, which somewhat 'fixes' the stack-problem).
CRLF can be used in Item Activation Messages, Folder or Download-File
Descriptions.
Multi-line messages are wrapped to the next line when reaching the end of a
line (the wrapping can occur anywhere within words, to avoid that effect one
must manually insert CRLF's (0Dh) at suitable locations). Some message boxes
are clipped to the visible number of lines, other messages boxes prompt the
user to push Button-A to read further lines.
Caution: CRLF will hang in Item-Descriptions (they do work in item shops, but
will hang in the Inventory menu; the only way to implement longer descriptions
here is to space-pad them so that the wrapping occurs at a suitable location).

SNES Cart Satellaview Channels and Channel Map
----------------------------------------------

Channels
Transmission is organized in "channels". Each can Channel transmits a single
Packet (which contains a File, or other special information like in Directory
and Time packets). There can be (theoretically) up to 4 billion logical
"Software Channels", but only 65536 physical "Hardware Channels". The latter
ones are those being currently transmitted, and which can be received by
programming the channel number into Port 2188h/218Eh.

Channel Map Packet (Hardware Channel 0124h)
Unlike normal packets (with 10-byte headers), this packet is preceeded by a
5-byte header.

Endianess of Numbers in Satellite Packets
In the satellite packets, all 16bit/24bit values (such like length or address
offsets) are in big-endian format (opposite of the SNES CPUs byte-order). For
the Hardware/Software Channel Numbers it's hard to say if they are meant to be
big-endian, little-endian, or if they are meant to be simple byte-strings
without endianess (see below for their ordering in practice).

Endianess of Hardware Channels
The endiness of the Hardware Channel numbers in Channel Map is same as in Port
2188h/218Eh. The endianess of the fixed values (0121h and 0124h) is also same
as Port 2188h/218Eh. Ie. one can use that values without needing to swap LSBs
and MSBs.

Endianess of Software Channels
The fixed 4-byte pairs are using same byte-order as how they are ordered in
Channel Map (for example, 1.2.0.48 means that 48 (30h) is at highest address).
So far it's simple. The (slightly) confusing part is that SNES software usually
encodes them as 2-word pairs (since the SNES uses a little-endian CPU, the
above example values would be 0201h.3000h).

SNES Cart Satellaview Town Status Packet
----------------------------------------

Town Status (Software Channel 1.1.0.5)
Loaded to 7EA31Dh, then copied to 7EA21Dh. Size (max) 256 bytes.
Uses a normal 10-byte fragment header, but with "4bit Transmission ID" and
"7bit Fragment Number" ignored, but still does use "Target Offset" for
fragment(s)?
  00h   1   Flags (bit0=1=Invalid) (bit1-7=unknown/unused)
  01h   1   Town Status ID (packet must be processed only if this ID changes)
  02h   1   Directory ID   (compared to Directory ID in Directory packet)

             (Or, maybe, the "Power-down" stuff enables satellite radio,
             being injected to audio-inputs on expansion port...?)

  17h   1   Number of File IDs (X) (may be 00h=none) (max=E8h)
  18h   X   File IDs (one byte each) (compared against File ID in Directory)
This packet should be (re-)downloaded frequently. The File IDs indicate which
Directory entries are valid (whereas, it seems to be possible to share the same
ID for ALL files), the Directory ID indicates if the Directory itself is still
valid.

Fountain/Replacement and Season
The animated Fountain (near beach stairs) has only decorative purposes (unlike
buildings/people that can contain folders). Optionally, the fountain can be
replaced by other (non-animated) decorative elements via Fountain Replacement
Flags in the Town Status packet: Bit0-11 are selecting element 1-12 (if more
than one bit is set, then the lowest bit is used) (if no bits are set, then the
fountain is used).
  None  00h Default Fountain (default when no bits set) (animated)
  Bit0  01h Jan     Altar with Apple or so
  Bit1  02h Feb     Red Roses arranged as a Heart
  Bit2  03h Mar     Mohican-Samurai & Batman-Joker

  Bit10 0Bh Nov     Red Hemp Leaf (cannabis/autum)
  Bit11 0Ch Dec     Christmas Tree (with special Gimmick upon accessing it)
As shown above, the 12 replacements are eventually associated with months
(Christmas in December makes sense... and Fish in May dunno why).
Bit12-15 of the above flags are selecting Season:
  None  00h Default (when no bits set)
  Bit12 01h Spring  (pale green grass) (seems to be same as default)
  Bit13 02h Summery (poppy colors with high contrast)
  Bit14 03h Autumn  (yellow/brown grass)
  Bit15 04h Winter  (snow covered)
As for the Fountain, default is used when no bits set, and lowest bit is used
if more than one bit is set.

The directory may contain files that aren't currently transmitted; check the
Town Status for list of currently available File IDs. Also check the Directory
ID in the Town Status, if it doesn't match up with the ID of the Directory
packet, then one must download the Directory again (otherwise one needs to
download it only once after power-up).

Include Files
Each File in the directory has an Include File entry. Before downloading a
file, the BIOS checks if the Include File's Software Channel Number is listed
in the Directory (in any folder(s) that are marked as containing Include
Files). If it isn't listed (or if it's N.N.0.0), then there is no include file.
If it is listed, then the BIOS does first download the include file, and
thereafter download the original file. Whereas, the include file itself may
also have an include file, and so on (the download order starts with the LAST
include file, and ends with the original file).
There are some incomplete dumps of some games, which have 1Mbyte FLASH dumped,
but do require additional data in WRAM/PSRAM:
  BS Dragon Quest (copy of channel_map in PSRAM, episode_number in WRAM)
  BS Zelda no Densetsu Kodai no Sekiban Dai 3 Hanashi (hw_channel in WRAM)
The missing data was probably transferred in form of Include files.

Streaming Files
There seems to be some streaming support:
Files flagged as FILE[22h+X].Bit3=1 are repeatedly downloaded-and-executed
again and again (possibly intended to produce movies/slideshows) (details: max
256K are loaded to upper half of PSRAM, and, if successfully received: copied
to lower 256K of PSRAM and executed in that place; whereas, the execution
starts once when receiving the next streaming block, that is: with a different
4bit transmission ID in the 10-byte packet header).
Moreover, Packets marked as having 00h fragments, are treated as having
infinite fragments (this would allow to overwrite received data by newer data;
though none of the higher-level BIOS functions seems to be using that feature).

Files Available at Home
Some files can be downloaded at the "Home" building (via the 3rd of the 4
options in that building), these "Home" files may be located in any folders,
namely, including following folders:
  FOLDER[00h].Bit0=Don't care (folder may be marked as hidden)
  FOLDER[18h+X]=Don't care    (folder may be also used as building/person/etc.)
For downloading them at "Home", the files must be defined as so:
  FILE[1Ah+X]<>0000h   (software channel isn't N.N.0.0)
  FILE[22h+X].Bit2=0   (flagged as available at home)
  FILE[18h]=Don't care (file description isn't shown at home)
BUG: If there are more than 32 such "Home" files, the BIOS tries to skip the
additional files, but destroys the stack alongside that attempt.
Note: Unlike other downloads, Home ones are always having a wooden-plank
background, and are done without transmission Interval timeouts. And, Include
Files are ignored. And, Autostart is disabled (ie. downloads to PSRAM are
totally useless, downloads to FLASH can/must be manually started).

SNES Cart Satellaview Expansion Data (at end of Directory Packets)

  04h   N   Expansion Chunk(s) (all values in chunks are LITTLE-ENDIAN)
For for some reason, there may be more than one of these entries, but the BIOS
does use only the first entry with [00h].Bit0=0=Valid (any further entries are
simply ignored).

Chunk 00h (End)
  00h        1   Chunk ID (00h)
Ends (any further following chunks are ignored). Chunk 00h should be probably
always attached at the end of the chunk list (although it can be omitted in
some cases, eg. after Chunk 02h).

Chunk 01h (Custom Building)
All values in this chunk are LITTLE-ENDIAN.

                 Door Locations work only if BG1 cells also have bit15 set!
                 Bit15 must be set IN FRONT of the door, this is effectively
                 reducing the building size from 4x7 to 4x6 cells.
                 Note: Animated BG cells are FORCEFULLY having bit15 cleared!
This chunk may be followed by Chunk 02h. If so, it processes Chunk 02h (and
ends thereafter). Otherwise it ends immediately (ie. when the following Chunk
has ID=00h) (or also on any "garbage" ID other than 02h).

Chunk 02h (Custom Persons)
  00h        1   Chunk ID (02h)
  01h        2   Chunk Length (N) (LITTLE-ENDIAN) (N may be even,odd,zero)
  03h        N   Data (copied to 7F0000h) (N bytes) (max 0A00h bytes or so)

                  08h .. 7F0008h  General Purpose (Further Tokens and Data)
Copies the Data, and ends (any further following chunks are ignored). If Person
2Ch/2Dh are enabled in the Town Status packet, then the person thread(s) are
created with above entrypoint(s). The threads may then install whatever OBJs
(for examples, see the table at 99DAECh, which contains initial X/Y-coordinates
and Entrypoints for Person 00h..3Fh).

Chunk 03h..FFh (Ignored/Reserved for future)
  00h        1   Chunk ID (03h..FFh)
  01h        2   Chunk Length (N) (LITTLE-ENDIAN)
  03h        N   Data (ignored/skipped)
Skips the data, and then goes on processing the following chunk.

BG Animation Data (within Chunk 01h) (for Custom Building)
  00h     2   Base.xloc (0..47) (FFFFh=No Animation Data)
  02h     2   Base.yloc (0..47)
  04h     X*4 Group(s) of 2 words (offset_to_frame_data,duration_in_60hz_units)
  04h+X*4 2   End (FFFEh=Loop/Repeat animation, FFFFh=Bugged/One-shot animat.)
  06h+X*4 ..  BG Animation Frame Data Block(s) (see below)
  ..      0-2 Padding (to avoid 100h-byte boundary BUG in L2)
Xloc/Yloc should be usually X=0006h,Y=000Dh (the location of the Custom
Building, at 7E4C8Ch) (although one can mis-use other xloc/yloc values to
animate completely different map locations; this works only if the Custom
Building's folder contains files/items).
BUG: The one-shot animation is applied ONLY to map cells that are INITIALLY
visible (ie. according to BG scroll offsets at time when entering the town).

BG Animation Frame Data Block(s)
  00h     Y*8 Group(s) of 4 words (xloc, yloc, bg1_cell, bg2_cell)
  00h+Y*8 2   End of Frame List (8000h) (ie. xloc=8000h=end)
NOTE: offset_to_frame_data is based at [94] (whereas, [94] points to the
location after Chunk 01h ID/Length, ie. to the base address of Chunk 01h plus
3).
If the animation goes forwards/backwards, one may use the same offsets for both
passes.
The Custom Bulding has 4x7 cells in non-animated form (so, usually one should
use xloc=0..3, yloc=0..6). Cells can be FFFFh=Don't change (usually one would
change only BG1 foreground cells, and set BG2 background cells to FFFFh). For
animated BG1 cells, Bit10-15 are stripped for some stupid reason (in result,
animated BG1 calls cannot be flagged as Doors via Bit15).

BG Cell to Tile Translation
Each 16x16 pixel Cell consists of four 8x8 Tiles. The Translation table
contains tiles arranged as Upper-Left, Lower-Left, Upper-Right, Lower-Right.
The 16bit table entries are 10bit BG tile numbers, plus BG attributes (eg.
xflip).

Building/Map Notes
The PPU runs in BG Mode 1 (BG1/BG2=16-color, BG3=4-color). VRAM used as so:

  BG2 64x32 map at VRAM:0800h-0FFFh, 8x8 tiles at VRAM:1000h-4FFFh (background)
  BG3 32x32 map at VRAM:5000h-53FFh, 8x8 tiles at VRAM:5000h-6FFFh (menu text)
  OBJ 8x8 and 16x16 tiles at VRAM:6000h-7FFFh (without gap)        (people)
  Custom BG1/BG2 Tiles are at VRAM:4900h-xxxxh (BG.Tile No 390h-xxxh)
  Custom OBJ Tiles at VRAM:7C00h-xxxxh (OBJ.Tile No 1C0h..xxxh)
The PPU BG Palettes are:
  BG.PAL0 Four 4-Color Palettes (for Y-Button BG3 Menu)
  BG.PAL1 Four 4-Color Palettes (for Y-Button BG3 Menu)
  BG.PAL2 Buildings

SNES Cart Satellaview Other Packets
-----------------------------------

SNES Patch Packet (by 105BBC) (Software Channel 1.1.0.7)
Loaded to 7FC000h, data portions then copied to specified addresses. Size (max)
16Kbytes.
  00h  1   Number of entries (01h..FFh) (MUST be min 01h)
  01h  ..  Entries (max 3FFFh bytes)
Each entry is:
  00h  1   Flags (bit0=1=Invalid) (bit1-7=unknown/unused)
  01h  1   Unknown/unused
  02h  2   Length (N) (16bit, big-endian) (MUST be min 0001h)
  04h  3   SNES-specific Memory Address (24bit, big-endian)
  07h  N   Data (N bytes)
The data portions are copied directly to the specified SNES addresses (the BIOS
doesn't add any base-offset to the addresses; ie. if the data is to be copied
to WRAM, then the satellite would transmit 7E0000h..7FFFFFh as address; there
is no address checking, ie. the packet can overwrite stack or I/O ports).

Welcome Message Packet (Software Channel 1.1.0.4)
Loaded to 7EA1B9. Size max 64h bytes (100 decimal). Displayed in text window
with 37x4 ASCII cells.
  00h  100 Custom Message (max 99 characters, plus ending 00h)
If this packet is included in the Channel Map (and if it's successfully
received), then the Custom Message is displayed right before entering the town.
The japanese Default Message is still displayed, too (so one gets two messages
- which is causing some annoying additional slowdown).

Time Channel Packet (Software channel 1.1.0.8) (BS Fire Emblem)
Time Channel Packet (Software channel 1.1.0.8) (BS Satella2 1)
Time Channel Packet (Software channel 1.1.0.8) (BS Parlor Parlor 2)

Time Channel Packet (Software channel 1.1.0.8) (BS Kodomo Tyosadan..)
Time Channel Packet (Software channel 1.1.0.8) (BS Super Mario USA 3)
Time Channel Packet (Software channel 1.1.0.8) (BS Super Mario Collection 3)
Time Channel Packet (Software channel 1.1.0.8) (BS Excitebike - Mario .. 4)
Time Channel Packet (Software channel 1.1.0.8) (Itoi Shigesato no Bass Tsuri)
Time Channel Packet (Software channel 1.2.0.48) (BS Dragon Quest 1)
Time Channel Packet (Software channel 1.2.0.48) (BS Zelda .. Remix)
Time Channel Packet (HW channel [7FFFF7h]) (BS Zelda - Kodai .. Dai 3 ..)
Time Channel Packet (HW channel [7FFFF7h]) (BS Marvelous Camp Arnold 1)
Time Channel Packet (HW channel [7FFFF7h]) (BS Marvelous Time Athletic 4)
Preceeded by a 10-byte packet header. Of which, first 5 bytes are ignored (Body
is 8-bytes, so packet size should be probably 5+8). Fixed 01h must be 01h.
Number of Fragments must be 01h. Target Offset must be 000000h. The 8-byte Data
Body is then:
  00h  1  Unknown/unused (probably NOT seconds) ;(un-)used by Itoi only
  01h  1  Minutes     (0..3Bh for 0..59)
  02h  1  Hours       (0..17h for 0..23) (or maybe 24..26 after midnight)
  03h  1  Day of Week (01h..07h) (rather not 00h..06h) (?=Monday)
  04h  1  Day         (01h..1Fh for 1..31)
  05h  1  Month       (01h..0Ch for 1..12)
  06h  1  Unknown/unused (maybe year)    ;\could be 2x8bit (00:00 to 99:99)
  07h  1  Unknown/unused (maybe century) ;/or maybe 16bit (0..65535) or so
Caution: The BS satellite program specified hours from 11..26 (ie. it didn't
wrap from 23 to 0), the Time Channel(s) might have been following that
notation; if so, then Date values might have also been stuck on the previous
day. Unknown if the Time Channels have been online 24 hours a day, or if their
broadcast ended at some time late-night.
Time Channel are often used by Soundlink games, in so far, it's also quite
possible that the "hours:minutes" are referring to the time within the
broadcast (eg. from 0:00 to 0:59 for a 1-hour broadcast duration), rather than
to a real-time-clock-style time-of-the-day.
Differences between 1.1.0.8 and 1.2.0.48 are unknown. Some games require
incoming Hardware channel number at [7FFFF7h] (from a separate loader or so).
One would expect TIME[0] to contain seconds - however, there aren't any games
using that entry as seconds (instead, they wait for minutes to change, and
reset seconds to zero; due to that wait-for-next-minute mechanism, many BSX
games seem to "hang" for up to 60 seconds after booting them).
TIME[4..7] aren't really used as "date" by any games (a few games seem to be
using TIME[4] or TIME[5] to determine how often the user has joined the game).
Itoi uses (and displays) TIME[4..5] as date.
Some games are treating TIME[6..7] as a 16bit little-endian value, others are
using only either TIME[6] or TIME[7] (ie. half of the games that use the "year"
values are apparently bugged).

File Packet (Software Channel N.N.N.N as taken from Directory)
  00h  N   Data, N bytes (N=Filesize as specified in Directory)
The file must contain a Satellaview Transmit Header (at file offset 7Fxxh or
FFxxh), that header is similar to the FLASH File Header. For details &
differences, see:
--> SNES Cart Satellaview FLASH File Header
The filesize should be usually a multiple of 128Kbytes (because the checksum in
File Header is computed accross that size). Transmitting smaller files is
possible with some trickery: For FLASH download, assume FLASH to be erased (ie.
expand checksum to FFh-filled 128Kbyte boundary). For PSRAM download, the
checksum isn't verified (so no problem there). Moreover, filesize should be
usually at least 32Kbytes (for LoROM header at 7Fxxh), however, one could
manipulate the fragment-offset in packet header (eg. allowing a 4Kbyte file to
be loaded to offset 7000h..7FFFh).

Special Channel(s) used by Itoi Shigesato no Bass Tsuri No. 1 (1.2.130.N)
Itoi supports four special channel numbers to unlock special contests. The game
doesn't try to receive any data on that channels (it only checks if one of them
is listen in the Channel Map).
  1.2.130.0      ;\Special Contests 1..4 (or so)
  1.2.130.16     ; The 4 contests are looking more or less the same, possibly
  1.2.130.32     ; with different parameters, different japanese descriptions,
  1.2.130.48     ;/contest 2-3 have "No fishing" regions in some lake-areas.
  1.2.130.other  ;-Invalid (don't use; shows error with TV-style "test screen")
For Itoi, the Channel Map may be max 1019 bytes (or even LESS?!) (unlike
usually, where it could be 1485 bytes). There should be only one channel with
value 1.2.130.N in the Channel Map. The game additionally requires the 1.1.0.8
Time Channel. And, uses the "APU" byte in the Town Status packet.

1.2.129.0  Special Channel used by Derby Stallion 96 (Dish on Building/Roof)
1.2.129.16 Special Channel used by Derby Stallion 96 (6th Main Menu Option)
Differences between the two channels are unknown; both are processed by the
same callback function (and thus seem to have the same data-format). The
packet(s) are both loaded to 7F0000h, size could be max 8000h (although, actual
size might be 7E00h, as indicated by the checksum calculation). The overall
format is:
  0000h 3    Unknown/unused (3 bytes)
  0003h 8    ID "SHVCZDBJ" (compared against [B289D6])
  000Bh 2    Number of Chunks at 0010h and up (16bit) (little-endian) (min 1)
  000Dh 1    Unknown/unused? (8bit)
  000Eh 1    Checksum (bytes at [0000h..7DFFh] added together) (8bit)
  000Fh 1    Checksum complement (8bit)
  0010h DF0h Chunks
  7E00h 200h Begin of non-checksummed area (IF ANY) (if it DOES exist,
             then it MIGHT contain a file-style header at 7FB0h..7FFFh ?)
Note: The Chunks processed via function at B28A10h. Despite of the hardcoded
channel numbers, the packets must be also listed (with the same channel
numbers) in the Directory Packet (as hidden Include File entries or so).

Hardware Channel 0121h - Test Channel
Used for hardware-connection test (received data is ignored). Used by BIOS
function 105B6Ch; which is used only when pressing X+L+R buttons while the
Welcome Message is displayed. Transmission Timeout for the Test Channel is 10
seconds.

SNES Cart Satellaview Buildings
-------------------------------

Home Building (Starting Point)
This building can be entered at any time, the four japanese options are:
  1) Load File from FLASH Card
  2) Delete File from FLASH Card
  3) Download File (only files that are "Available at Home") (max 32 files)
  4) Delete Settings in SRAM

People
People are showing up only if they are flagged in the 64bit People Present

  3Ah Mr.Money (near police) (donates a 5000G coin) ;/all do act as Folder 38h
  3Bh-3Fh Unused?
Like Buildings, People can have a Folder associated to them (using above values
as Folder ID, at least, that works for People 00h..2Bh).
If there is no corresponding folder transmitted, then People aren't doing
anything useful (aside from producing whatever japanese sentences). One
exception: If there's no People-File-Folder with ID=01h, then the Spring-boot
guy acts as "Dr Hiroshi's Shop" where one can buy question-marked items for
3000G. The Frogs can be picked up (adding an Item to the inventory). Frog
positions seem to be random (west of Robot-Skyscraper, street near Turtle
Arena, northwest lawn, or near Cow-Skull Church).

Avatars
These are assigned for folders (either for people in buildings, or people on
the streets).
  00h Geisha (faecher)

  0Fh Blonde chick (blonde, lipstick)
  10h BS-X logo (not a person, just the "BS-X" letters)
  11h-FFh Unknown/Unused/Crashes
  30h None (seems to be an un-intended effect, probably unstable, don't use)

 18 88CF91h Change GUI Cursor Shape          (from Frog 35h) (works only once)

Item Format
As shown above, 25 items are defined in ROM at 99C229h-88D020h with 8Fh bytes
per item. Custom Items (defined in Directory packet's "File" entries) can be
stored at 10506Ah. The item format is:
  00h 15h Item Name (max 20 chars, plus ending 00h) (First 2 bytes 00h = Free)
  15h 1   Length of following (Description, Pointer, Whatever) (always 79h?)
  16h 25h Item Description (max 36 chars, plus ending 00h)
  3Bh 47h Item Activation Message (max 70 chars, plus ending 00h)
   If Activation Message = empty (single 00h byte), then Item Function follows:
   3Ch 3   Pointer to Interpreter Tokens (eg. 99974Dh for Transfer Device)
   3Fh 43h Unknown/Unused/Padding (should be zero)
   (there is no SRAM allocated for custom item functions,
   so this part may be used only for predefined ROM items)
  82h 12  Item Price (12-Digit ASCII String, eg. "000000001200" for 1200G)
  8Eh 1   Item Drop/Keep Flag (00h=Drop after Activation, 01h=Keep Item)
In case of Custom Items, above ITEM[00h..8Eh] is copied from FILE[02h..90h]
(ie. a fragment of "File" Entries in the Directory Packet).
Entry [15h] seems to be always 79h, giving a total length of 8Fh per item.
The Item Message is used for items that cannot be activated (eg. "You can't use
telephone card outside of the phoone booth.",00h). If the message is empty
(00h), then the next 24bit are a pointer to the item handler (eg. the Teleport
function for the Transfer Device).
Note: Items can be listed, activated, and dropped via Y-Button. The teleport
device can be also activated via X-button.

Shops
There are four pre-defined shops: Dr.Hiroshi's appears when Person 01h exists,
WITHOUT folder assigned, or WITH an item-folder. The Beach Shop, C-Skyscraper
and Sewerage Shops appear if they HAVE an folder assigned, the folder must be
flagged as Item/Shop. In all cases, the folder may contain additional items
which are added to the Shop's predefined item list. Custom Shops can be created
by assigning Item-Folders to other People/Buildings (in that case, the Folder
MUST contain at least one item, otherwise the BIOS shows garbage). Shops may
contain max 0Ah items (due to 7E865Eh array size).

SNES Cart Satellaview SRAM (Battery-backed)
-------------------------------------------

The Satellaview BIOS cartridge contains 32Kbyte battery-backed SRAM, mapped to
eight 4Kbyte chunks at 5000h..5FFFh in Bank 10h..17h.

  7826h-7827h  BS Dr. Mario (only 2 bytes used?)
 (7C00h-7FFFh) BS Radical Dreamers (default, if free, at 7C00h) (1Kbyte)
There is no filesystem with filenames nor SRAM allocation. Most are using
hardcoded SRAM addresses, and do overwrite any other data that uses the same
addresses.
One exception is BS Radical Dreamers: The game searches for a free (zerofilled)
1K block (defaults to using 7C00h-7FFFh), if there isn't any free block, then
it prompts the user to select a 1K memory block (at 6000h-7FFFh) to be
overwritten.
Some games are saving data in PSRAM (eg. Zelda no Densetsu: Kamigami no
Triforce, in bank 70h) rather than SRAM - that kind of saving survives Reset,
but gets lost on power-off.
There aren't any known BS games that save data in FLASH memory. Some BS games
are using passwords instead of saving.

BIOS Hooks
These are 4-byte fields, usually containing a "JMP 80xxxxh" opcode (or a "RETF"
opcode in a few cases), changing them to "JMP 1x5xxxh" allows to replace the
normal BIOS functions by updated functions that are installed in SRAM. Unknown
if any such BIOS updates do exist, and at which SRAM locations they are
intended/allowed to be stored.

SRAM Speed
The Satellaview SRAM is mapped to a FAST memory area with 3.58MHz access time
(unlike ALL other SNES RAM chips like internal WRAM or external SRAM in other
cartridges).
The bad news is that this wonderful FAST memory isn't usable: It's located in
Bank 10h-17h, so it isn't usable as CPU Stack or CPU Direct Page (both S and D
registers can access Bank 00h only). And, the first 24Kbytes are used as
reserved (and checksummed) area.

SNES Cart Satellaview FLASH File Header
---------------------------------------

Satellaview FLASH File Header
Located at offset 7Fxxh or FFxxh in file, mapped to FFxxh in bank 00h.
  FFB0h 2  Maker Code (2-letter ASCII)                   ;\garbage when
  FFB2h 4  Program Type (00000100h=Tokens, Other=65C816) ; [FFDBh]=01h
  FFB6h 10 Reserved (zero)                               ;/
  FFC0h 16 Title (7bit ASCII, 8bit JIS (?), and 2x8bit SHIFT-JIS supported)
  FFD0h 4  Block Allocation Flags (for 32 blocks of 128Kbytes each) (1=used)
              Retail (demo) games usually have ffff here -- Uh ???
              (exception BS Camp Arnold Marvelous)       -- Uh ???
  FFD4h 2  Limited Starts (bit15=0=Infinite, otherwise bit14-0=Remaining Flags)
  FFD6h 1  Date (Bit7-4=Month, Bit3-0=0)             ;\copied to from
  FFD7h 1  Date (Bit7-3=Day, Bit2=0, Bit1-0=Unknown) ;/Directory Packet
  FFD8h 1  Map Mode (20h=LoROM, 21h=HiROM) (or sometimes 30h/31h)
  FFD9h 1  File/Execution Type
            Bit0-3  Unknown/unused (usually/always 0)
            Bit4    Receiver Power Down (0=No/Sound Link, 1=Power-Down 2197h)
            Bit5-6  Execution Area (0=FLASH, 1=Reloc FLASH-to-PSRAM, 2/3=Fail)
            Bit7    Skip the "J033-BS-TDM1 St.GIGA" Intro (0=Normal, 1=Skip)
  FFDAh 1  Fixed (33h)
  FFDBh 1  Unknown (usually 02h, sometimes 01h, or rarely 00h) (see FFBxh)
  FFDCh 2  Checksum complement (same as below, XORed with FFFFh)
  FFDEh 2  Checksum (all bytes added together; assume [FFB0-DF]=00h-filled)
  FFE0h 32 Exception Vectors (IRQ,NMI,Entrypoint,etc.) (for 65C816 code)
Entrypoint is at 800000h+[FFFCh] for 65C816 Machine Code, or at 400000h for
Interpreter Tokens (ie. when [FFB2h]=00000100h, as used by few magazines like
BS Goods Press 6 Gatsu Gou).
Caution: Machine Code programs are started WITHOUT even the most basic
initialization (one of the more bizarre pieces: the download "screensaver" may
leave HDMAs enabled when auto-starting a downloaded file).

Satellaview PSRAM File Header (download to PSRAM without saving in FLASH)
Basically same as FLASH headers. FFD9h.Bit7 (skip intro) seems to be ignored
(accidently using FFD9h from FLASH cartridge instead from PSRAM?). The checksum
isn't verified (FFDEh must match with FFDCh, but doesn't need to match the
actual file content).

Satellaview Transmit Header (located at 7Fxxh or FFxxh in File)
Basically same as normal Satellaview FLASH File Header. However, after
downloading a file (and AFTER storing it in FLASH memory), the BIOS does
overwrite some Header entries:
  FFD0h  4-byte  Block Allocation field (set to whichever used FLASH Blocks)
  FFD6h  2-byte  Date field (set to Date from Satellite Directory Entry)
  FFDAh  1-byte  Fixed Value (set to 33h)
Since FLASH cannot change bits from 0 to 1 (without erasing), the above values
must be FFh-filled in the transmitted file (of course, for the fixed value, 33h
or FFh would work) (and of course, the FFh-requirement applies only to FLASH
downloads, not PSRAM downloads).

Notes
The title can be 16 bytes (padded with 20h when shorter), either in 7bit ASCII,
8bit JIS (or so?), or 2x8bit SHIFT-JIS, or a mixup thereof. A few files are
somewhat corrupted: Title longer than 16 bytes (and thereby overlapping the
Block Allocation flags).
Limited Starts consists of 15 flags (bit14-0), if the limit is enabled (bit15),
then one flag is changed from 1-to-0 each time when starting the file (the
1-to-0 change can be done without erasing the FLASH sector).
Note that the checksum excludes bytes at FFB0h-FFDFh, this is different as in
normal cartridges (and makes it relative easy to detect if a file contains a
SNES ROM-image or a Satellaview FLASH-file/image.
Files are treated as "deleted" if their Fixed Value isn't 33h, if Limited
Starts is 8000h (limit enabled, and all other bits cleared), or if Checksum
Complement entry isn't equal to Checksum entry XOR FFFFh. Some FLASH dumps in
the internet do have experired Limited Starts entries (so they can be used only
when changing [FFD4h] to a value other than 8000h).
The FLASH card PCBs can be fitted with 1/2/4 MByte chips (8/16/32 Mbit). As far
as known, all existing FLASH cards contain 1MByte chips (so Block Allocation
bit8-31 should be usually always 0). Most files are occupying the whole 1MByte
(so bit0-7 should be usually all set). There are also some 256Kbyte and
512Kbyte files (where only 2 or 4 bits would be set). Minimum file size would
be 128Kbyte. Odd sizes like 768Kbytes would be also possible.
Unlike the Satellite Packet Headers, the FLASH/Transmit-File header contains
"normal" little-endian numbers.

SNES Cart Satellaview BIOS Function Summary
-------------------------------------------

BIOS functions must be called with BIOS ROM enabled in Bank 80h-9Fh (in some
cases it may be required also in Bank 00h-1Fh), and with DB=80h.
Incoming/outgoing Parameters are passed in whatever CPU registers and/or
whatever WRAM locations. WRAM is somewhat reserved for the BIOS (if a FLASH
file changes WRAM, then it should preserve a backup-copy in PSRAM, and restore
WRAM before calling BIOS functions) (WRAM locations that MAY be destroyed are
7E00C0h..7E00FFh and 7E1500h..7E15FFh, and, to some level: 7F0000h..7FFFFFh,
which is used only as temporary storage).

Returning to BIOS
If an executable file wants to return control to BIOS, it must first reset the
APU (if it has uploaded code to it), and then it can do one the following:
Perform a warmboot (the BIOS intro is skipped, but the Welcome message is
re-displayed, and the player is moved back to the Home building):
  jmp 105C3Ch   ;srv_reboot_bios (simple, but quite annoying)
Or return to the BIOS NMI handler (from within which the executable was
started) this is done by many games (player returns to the most recently

  88D076h CallTestIfDoor()
  99D9A4h CallSelectPlayerAsSecondaryThread  ;[19A4]=PlayerThreadId*2
Note: Some of these Call addresses are also listed in a 24bit-pointer table at
address 808000h (though the (BIOS-)code uses direct 8xxxxxh values instead of
indirect [808xxxh] values).

Token Functions (some predefined token-functions)
These can be invoked with GOSUB token (or GOTO or used as thread entrypoint):
  99D69A EnterTown (use via goto, or use as entrypoint)
  828230 DeallocMostBgPalettesAndBgTiles ;except tile 000h and color 00h-1Fh
  88C1C6 SetCursorShape0
  88C1D0 SetCursorShape1
  88C1E0 SetCursorShape2
  88C1EA SetCursorShape3
  88C1F4 SetCursorShape4
  88C1FE SetCursorShape5
  99D8AB PauseSubThreadIfXYstepIsZero
  99D8CD MoveWithinX1andX2boundaries
  99D903 MoveWithinY1andY2boundaries
Note: Some of the above functions are also listed in the table at 808000h.

Compressed Data
Some of the Functions can (optionally) use compressed Tile/Map/Palette data.
--> SNES Decompression Formats
Note: The actual compressed data is usually preceeded-by or bundled-with
compression flags, length entry, and/or (in-)direct src/dest pointers (that
"header" varies from function to function).

Data Packs are Satellaview 8M Memory Packs which have data meant to be used as
expansion for a Data Pack-compatible game. Data Pack-compatible game cartridges
have a resemblence to the BS-X Cartridge itself.

Usage
For most of these games, Data was distributed via St.GIGA's Satellaview
services. Same Game and SD Gundam G-Next had some Data Packs sold as retail in
stores. RPG Tsukuru 2, Sound Novel Tsukuru and Ongaku Tsukuru Kanaderu could
save user-created data to 8M Memory Packs.

Cartridges with Data Pack Slot
  Derby Stallion 96                  (SpecialLoROM, 3MB)
  Itoi Shigesato no Bass Tsuri No. 1 (SA-1, map-able 4MB ROM, 8K RAM)
  Joushou Mahjong Tenpai             (HiROM, 1MB)
  Ongaku Tukool/Tsukuru Kanaderu     (HiROM, 1MB)
  RPG Tukool/Tsukuru 2               (LoROM, 2MB)
  Same Game Tsume Game               (HiROM, 1MB)
  Satellaview BS-X BIOS              (MCC, 1MB ROM) (FLASH at C00000h)
  SD Gundam G-NEXT                   (SA-1, map-able 1.5MB ROM,32K RAM)
  Sound Novel Tukool/Tsukuru         (SpecialLoROM, 3MB)
Aside from the BS-X BIOS, two of the above games are also accessing BS-X
hardware via I/O Ports 2188h/2194h/etc (Derby Stallion 96, Itoi Shigesato no
Bass Tsuri No. 1). For doing that, the cartridges do probably require the
EXPAND pin to be wired properly (ie. wired to REFRESH or so?).

Cartridge Header of cartridges with Data Pack Slot
The presence of Data Pack Slots is indicated by a "Z" as first letter of Game
Code:
  [FFB2h]="Z"   ;first letter of game code
  [FFB5h]<>20h  ;game code must be 4-letters (not space padded 2-letters)
  [FFDAh]=33h   ;game code must exist (ie. extended header must be present)

Data Pack Mapping
  MCC (BSX-BIOS)        FLASH at C00000h (continous) (mappable via MCC chip)
  SA-1                  FLASH at <unknown address> (probably mappable via SA1)
  HiROM                 FLASH at E00000h (probably continous)
  LoROM/SpecialLoROM    FLASH at C00000h (looks like 32K chunks)

LoROM/SpecialLoROM Mapping Notes
The FLASH memory seems to be divided into 32K chunks (mirrored to Cn0000h and
Cn8000h) (of which, Derby Stallion 96 uses Cn8000h, RPG Tukool uses Cn0000h,
and Ongaku Tukool uses both Cn0000h and Cn8000h).
The two 3MB SpecialLoROM games also have the ROM mapped in an unconventional
fashion:
  1st 1MB mapped to banks 00-1F
  2nd 1MB mapped to banks 20-3F and A0-BF
  3rd 1MB mapped to banks 80-9F
Desipte of memory-mirroring of 2nd MB, the checksum-mirroring goes on 3rd MB?
Note: Above mapping differs from "normal" 3MB LoROM games like Wizardry 6
(which have 3rd 1MB in banks 40h-5Fh).

SNES Cart Nintendo Power (flashcard)
------------------------------------

Nintendo Power cartridges are official FLASH cartridges from Nintendo (released
only in Japan). Unlike the older Satellaview FLASH cartridges, they do connect
directly to the SNES cartridge slot. The capacity is 4MByte FLASH and 32KByte
battery-backed SRAM.

FLASH (512Kbyte blocks)
The FLASH is divided into eight 512Kbyte blocks. The first block does usually
contain a Game Selection Menu, the other blocks can contain up to seven
512KByte games, or other combinations like one 3MByte game and one 512KByte
game. Alternately, the cartridge can contain a single 4MByte game (in that
case, without the Menu).

SRAM (2Kbyte blocks) (battery-backed)
The SRAM is divided into sixteen 2Kbyte blocks for storing game positions.
Games can use one or more (or all) of these blocks (the menu doesn't use any of
that memory).

Nintendo Power Games
Games have been available at kiosks with FLASH Programming Stations. There are
around 150 Nintendo Power games: around 21 games exclusively released only for
Nintendo Power users, and around 130 games which have been previously released
as normal ROM cartridges.

SNES Cart Nintendo Power - I/O Ports
------------------------------------

Nintendo Power I/O Ports
The I/O ports at 002400h-002401h are used for mapping a selected game. Done as
follows:
  mov  [002400h],09h
  cmp  [002400h],7Dh
  jne  $  ;lockup if invalid
  mov  [002401h],28h
  mov  [002401h],84h
  mov  [002400h],06h
  mov  [002400h],39h
  mov  [002400h],80h+(Directory[n*2000h+0] AND 0Fh)
  jmp  $  ;lockup (until reset applies)
After the last write,the MX15001 chip maps the desired file, and does then
inject a /RESET pulse to the SNES console, which resets the CPU, APU (both SPC
and DSP), WRAM (address register), and any Expansion Port hardware (like
Satellaview), or piggyback cartridges (like Xband modem). The two PPU chips and
the CIC chip aren't affected by the /RESET signal. The overall effect is that
it boots the selected file via it's Reset vector at [FFFCh].
Note that the written value is the file index (ie. 80h+02h for the 2nd file),
not a memory block number. So the MX15001 must somewhere look-up directory
information for actually mapping the corresponding FLASH and SRAM blocks.

FLASH Base Address
The Block Number of the first FLASH block is stored at [0001h] in the
Directory. The MX15001 chip might use the entry for mapping FLASH, unless the
MX15001 contains its own rewrite-able directory memory (?)

SRAM Base Address (Unknown)
As by now, nobody does seem to have ever dumped Nintendo Power directory
entries for games that do contain SRAM. So far it's totally unknown if there is
a "First SRAM Block" entry in the directory (if it is there, then it'd be
probably located in some bits at [0000h..0002h]). If there is no entry, then
one could probably calculate it by summing-up the SRAM size entries from the
<preceeding> Directory Entries.
As for the actual SRAM mapping, the MX15001 may look-up the FLASH directory, or
its own rewrite-able directory memory (in case such memory does exist).

SRAM/FLASH Limits (Unknown)
Unknow if the hardware does apply any mapping limits (so that only the blocks
used by a specfic game are mapped into memory).

LoROM Mapping (Unknown)
Most games (and the Menu) are using LoROM mapping, with up to 2MB in 64 banks
of 32K in bank 00h-3Fh and mirrors in bank 80h-BFh. So far it's simple. The
unknown part is that there are also 4MB games, that exceed the above 64 banks;
the extra memory is probably somehow mapped in the "HiROM" area in banks
40h-7Dh and C0h-FFh. However, details are unknown.

HiROM Mapping (Unknown)
The Menu, and games like Contra and Parodius are using LoROM mapping. Games
like Rockman 7 are using HiROM mapping. The Directory doesn't NOT contain any
HiROM flag (and in case of 4MB games, there isn't a Directory at all). So, it's
unclear how the hardware can know whether to map LoROM or HiROM, possible ways
would be:
  - Upper/Lower 32K are exchanged in 64K HiROM banks (vectors always at 7Fxxh)
  - Hardware examines headers at 7Fxxh and FFxxh in selected 512K block
  - The MX15001 chips contains rewrite-able memory (with more directory info)
There are also

FLASH Chip Programming (Unknown)
The Bootmenu only allows file-selection, but doesn't contain any programming
functions. The games do probably (?) only use SRAM as storage, and thus don't
contain any FLASH programming functions either. So, programming functions seem
to exist only in the official programming devices (located in shops).
The "MX 29F1601MC-11C3" chip is probably a variant of the 29F1610, 29F1611,
29F1615 chips from Macronix (the chip's part number really ends with "01", not
with "10", "11", nor "15"), if so, then it should be programmed by writing
commands to address xx5555h and xx2AAAh, and the erase sector size would be
128Kbytes). Though Nintendo may have also installed different FLASH chips from
other makers and with other protocols in some cartridges(?)
To prevent piracy, it's quite likely that the MX15001 prevents writes to FLASH
memory unless it has received some special unlocking command, there may be also
special (SNES-incompatible) cartridge slot pin-outs required for writing;
unknown if any such protection does exist & how it does work.

  070000h     8E8000h      10000h Unused (FFh-filled)
The last 64Kbyte are probably usable as further file entries in cartridges
bigger than 4Mbyte (the Menu software in the existing cartridges is hardcoded
to process only files 1..7) (whilst Port 2400h seems to accept 4bit file
numbers).

Directory Entry Format
  0000h 1    Directory index (00h..07h for Entry 0..7) (or FFh=Unused Entry)
  0001h 1    First 512K-FLASH block (00h..07h for block 0..7)
  0002h 1    Unknown (usually 00h) maybe First ??K-SRAM block and/or Hirom flag
  0003h 2    Number of 512K-FLASH blocks (mul 4) (=0004h..001Ch for 1..7 blks)
  0005h 2    Number of 2K-SRAM blocks (mul 16)   (=0000h..0100h for 0..16 blks)
  0007h 12   Gamecode (eg. "SHVC-MENU-  ", "SHVC-AGPJ-  ", or "SHVC-CS  -  ")
  0013h 44   Title in Shift-JIS format (padded with 00h's) (not used by Menu)
  003Fh 384  Title Bitmap (192x12 pixels, in 30h*8 bytes, ie. 180h bytes)
  01BFh 10   Date "MM/DD/YYYY"
  01C9h 8    Time "HH:MM:SS"
  01D1h 8    Law  "LAWnnnnn" (eg. "LAW01712")
  01D9h 7703 Unused (1E17h bytes, FFh-filled)
  1FF0h 16   For File0: "MULTICASSETTE 32" / For Files 1-7: Unused (FFh-filled)

Directory Index
Directory Index indicates if the Entry is used (FFh=unused). If it is used,
then it must be equal to the current directory entry number (ie. a rather
redundant thing, where the index is indexing itself). The lower 4bit of the
index value is written to Port 2400h, which is probably causing the MX15001
chip to load the First FLASH/SRAM block numbers from the corresponding
directory entry, and to apply them as mapping base addresses.

First FLASH/SRAM Block
The First FLASH block number is stored in lower some bits of [0001h]. There is
probably also an entry for the First SRAM block number, possibly in whatever
bits at [0001h] or [0002h]? The directory doesn't contain any flag that
indicates HiROM or LoROM mapping.
The Menu doesn't use these entries, instead, they are probably automatically
deciphered by the MX15001 chip. [This isn't verified. Another theory found in
internet claims that the Block-numbers are stored in additional FLASH memory
contained in the MX15001 chip - however, that theory isn't verfied either.]
There seems to be no support for fragmented FLASH/SRAM files (ie. the
programming station must probably erase & rewrite the entire cartridge, with
the old used/unused blocks re-ordered so that they do form continous memory
blocks).

Number of FLASH/SRAM Blocks (displayed in Menu)
These entries are used to display the amount of used/unused blocks. Free FLASH
blocks are shown as blue "F" symbols, free SRAM blocks as red "B" symbols, used
blocks as gray "F" and "B" symbols. The menu doesn't show <which> game uses how
many blocks.

Title Bitmap (displayed in Menu)
The 192x12 pixel title bitmap is divided into eight 24x12 pixel sections, using
a most bizarre encoding: Each section is 30h bytes in size (enough for 32 pixel
width, but of these 32 pixels, the "middle" 4 pixels are overlapping each
other, and the "right-most" 4 pixels are unused. The byte/pixel order for 12
rows (y=0..11) is:
  Left 8 pixels   = (Byte[00h+y*2])
  Middle 8 pixels = (Byte[01h+y*2]) OR (Byte[18h+y*2] SHR 4)
  Right 8 pixels  = (Byte[18h+y*2] SHL 4) OR (Byte[19h+y*2] SHR 4)
The result is displayed as a normal 192-pixel bitmap (without any spacing
between the 24-pixel sections). The bits in the separate bytes are bit7=left,
bit0=right. Color depth is 1bit (0=dark/background, 1=bright/text). The bitmap
does usually contain japanese text without "special" features, though it could
also be used for small icons, symbols, bold text, greek text, etc.

Text Fields (not used by Menu)
The Shift-JIS Title, and ASCII Game Code, Date, Time, Law & Multicassete
strings aren't used by the Menu. The 5-digit Law number is usually (always?)
same for all files on the cartridge, might be the serial number of the
cartridge, or of the station that has programmed it. The Multicassette number
does probably indicate the FLASH size in MBits (it's always 32 for the existing
32Mbit/4MByte cartridges).

SNES Cart Sufami Turbo (Mini Cartridge Adaptor)
-----------------------------------------------

The Sufami Turbo from Bandai is an adaptor for low-cost mini-cartridges. Aside
from cost-reduction, one special feature is that one can connect two cartridges
at ones (so two games could share ROM or SRAM data). The BIOS in the adaptor
provides a huge character set, which may allow to reduce ROM size of the games.

--> SNES Cart Sufami Turbo General Notes
--> SNES Cart Sufami Turbo ROM/RAM Headers
--> SNES Cart Sufami Turbo BIOS Functions & Charset

SNES Cart Sufami Turbo General Notes
------------------------------------

Sufami Turbo Hardware
The "adaptor" connects to the SNES cartridge socket, it contains the BIOS ROM,
and two slots for "mini-carts". Slot A for the game being played, Slot B can
contain another game (some games include features that allow to access game
position data from other games, some may also access ROM data from other
games).
Technicals details are unknown... what hardware is in the adaptor, what is in
the mini-carts, which of them contain CIC chips, is the SRAM located in BIOS or
Game cartridge (looking at the BIOS/Game code, both seems likely, Game cart
maybe a bit more likely), what is the physical SRAM size (is there enough
memory for more than one file), what are the cartridge slot-pinouts...?

Sufami Turbo Memory Map
  00-1F:8000h-FFFFh  BIOS ROM (always 256Kbytes)             (max 1MByte)
  20-3F:8000h-FFFFh  Cartridge A ROM (usually 512Kbytes)     (max 1MByte)
  40-5F:8000h-FFFFh  Cartridge B ROM (usually 512Kbytes)     (max 1MByte)
  60-63:8000h-FFFFh  Cartridge A SRAM (usually 0/2/8 Kbytes) (max 128Kbyte)
  70-73:8000h-FFFFh  Cartridge B SRAM (usually 0/2/8 Kbytes) (max 128Kbyte)
  80-FF:8000h-FFFFh  Mirror of above banks

Memory Notes
The BIOS detects max 128Kbyte (64 pages) SRAM per slot, some games are (maybe
accidently) exceeding that limit (eg. Poi Poi Ninja zerofills 256 pages). Some
games (eg. SD Gundam Part 1) access SRAM slot B at 700000h rather than 708000h.
Some games (eg. SD Ultra Battle) may fail if the SRAM in slot B is
uninitialized (ie. before linking games in Slot A and B, first launch them
separately in Slot A).
When not using BIOS functions, one can destroy all WRAM locations, except for
WRAM[00000h] (which MUST be nonzero to enable the Game NMI handler & disable
the BIOS NMI handler).

Sufami Turbo ROM Images
The games are typically 512Kbyte or 1MByte in size. Existing ROM-Images are
often 1.5Mbytes or 2MBytes - those files do include the 256KByte BIOS-ROM
(banks 00h-07h), plus three mirrors of the BIOS (banks 08h-1Fh), followed by
the actual 512Kbyte or 1MByte Game ROM (bank 20h-2Fh or 20h-3Fh).
There are also a few 3MByte ROM-images, with additional mirrors of the game
(bank 30h-3Fh), followed by a second game (bank 40h-4Fh), followed by mirrors
of the second game (bank 50h-5Fh).
That formats are simple (but very bloated) solutions to load the BIOS & Game(s)
as a "normal" LoROM file.

Sufami Turbo Games
There have been only 13 games released:
  Crayon Shin Chan
  Gegege No Kitarou
  Gekisou Sentai Car Ranger
  Poi Poi Ninja                    ;-link-able with itself (2-player sram)
  Sailor Moon Stars Panic 2
  SD Gundam Generations: part 1    ;\
  SD Gundam Generations: part 2    ;

  SD Gundam Generations: part 5    ;
  SD Gundam Generations: part 6    ;/
  SD Ultra Battle: Seven Legend    ;\link-able with each other
  SD Ultra Battle: Ultraman Legend ;/
All of them available only in Japan, released between June & September 1996.
Thereafter, the games may have been kept available for a while, but altogether,
it doesn't seem to have been a too successful product.

SNES Cart Sufami Turbo ROM/RAM Headers
--------------------------------------

Sufami Turbo BIOS ROM Header
The BIOS has a rather incomplete Nintendo-like header at ROM Offset 07FB0h
(mapped to 00FFB0h):
  FFB0h Maker Code "B2"                        ;\extended header, present
  FFB2h Game Code "A9PJ"                       ; even though [FFDAh]<>33h
  FFB6h Reserved (10x00h)                      ;/
  FFC0h Title "ADD-ON BASE CASSETE  " (really mis-spelled, with only one "T")
  FFD4h Mapmode (always 30h = Fast LoROM)
  FFD5h Reserved (6x00h) (no ROM/RAM size entries, no ext.header-flag, etc.)
  FFDCh Dummy "checksum" value (always FFh,FFh,00h,00h)
  FFE0h Exception Vectors (IRQ,NMI,Entrypoint,etc.)
And, there is a header-like data field at ROM-Offset 00000h (mapped to 808000h)
(this part isn't really a header, but rather contains ID strings that are used
by the BIOS, for comparing them with Game ROM/SRAM):
  8000h 16 "BANDAI SFC-ADX",0,0   ;Game ROM ID
  8010h 16 "SFC-ADX BACKUP",0,0   ;Game SRAM ID

Sufami Turbo Game ROM Header (40h bytes)
Located at ROM Offset 00000h (mapped to 208000h/408000h for Slot A/B):
  00h 14 ID "BANDAI SFC-ADX" (required, compared against 14-byte ID in BIOS)
  0Eh 2  Zero-filled
  10h 14 Title, padded with spaces (can be 7bit ASCII and 8bit Japanese)
  1Eh 2  Zero-filled
  20h 2  Entrypoint (in bank 20h) ;game starts here (if it is in Slot A)
  22h 2  NMI Vector (in bank 20h) ;if RAM[000000h]=00h: use BIOS NMI handler
  24h 2  IRQ Vector (in bank 20h)
  26h 2  COP Vector (in bank 20h)
  28h 2  BRK Vector (in bank 20h)
  2Ah 2  ABT Vector (in bank 20h)
  2Ch 4  Zero-filled
  30h 3  Unique 24bit ID of a Game (or series of games) (usually 0xh,00h,0yh)
  33h 1  Index within a series (01h and up) (eg. 01h..06h for Gundam 1-6)
  34h 1  ROM Speed (00h=Slow/2.68Mhz, 01h=Fast=3.58MHz)
  35h 1  Chipset/Features (00h=Simple, 01h=SRAM or Linkable?, 03h=Special?)
  36h 1  ROM Size in 128Kbyte Units (04h=512K, 08h=1024K)
  37h 1  SRAM Size in 2Kbyte Units (00h=None, 01h=2K, 04h=8K)
  38h 8  Zero-filled
Some games have additional 64 header-like bytes at ROM Offset 40h..7Fh
  40h 1  Program code/data in some carts, 00h or 01h in other carts
  41h 63 Program code/data in some carts, 00h-filled in other carts
The game cartridges don't use/need a Nintendo-like header at 7Fxxh/FFxxh, but
some games like SDBATTLE SEVEN do have one.

Sufami Turbo SRAM File Header (30h bytes)

  0024h 1  Filesize (in 2Kbyte units)    (same as 0037h in ROM Header)
  0025h 11 Zero-filled
The BIOS file-functions are only reading entry 0000h (ID) and 0024h (Filesize),
the BIOS doesn't write anything, all IDs and values must be filled-in by the
game.
SRAM is organized so that used 2Kbyte pages are at lower addresses, free pages
at higher addresses (deleting a file in the middle will relocate any pages at
higher addresses). Accordingly, files are always consisting of unfragmented
continous page numbers (leaving apart that there are 32Kbyte gaps in the memory
map).

SNES Cart Sufami Turbo BIOS Functions & Charset
-----------------------------------------------

Sufami Turbo BIOS Function Summary
BIOS Function vectors (jmp 80xxxxh opcodes) are located at 80FF00h..80FF3Bh,
(the first 12 (of the 15) functions are also duplicated at 80FF80h..80FFAFh).
  80FF00  FillSramPages  ;in: AL=num, AH=slot, XL=first, [09h]=fillword
  80FF04  CopySramToSram ;in: AL=num, AH=direction, X/Y=first (slot A/B)
  80FF08  CopySramToWram ;in: AL=num, AH=direction, X=first, Y=slot, [09h]=addr
  80FF0C  GetChar2bpp    ;in: A=char(0000h..0FFFh), [06h]=dest_addr (64 bytes)
  80FF10  GetChar4bpp    ;in: A=char(0000h..0FFFh), [06h]=dest_addr (128 bytes)
  80FF14  GetCartType    ;out: AL/AH=Types for Slot A/B, b0=ROM, b1=SRAM, b2=?
  80FF18  GetSramSize    ;out: AL/AH=Sizes for Slot A/B, 0-4=0,2,8,32,128Kbyte
  80FF1C  FindFreeSram   ;in: AL=slot, out: AL=first_free_page, FFh=none
  80FF20  GetSramAddrTo6 ;in: AL=slot, XL=page, out: [06h]=addr
  80FF24  GetSramAddrTo9 ;in: AL=slot, XL=page, out: [09h]=addr
  80FF28  ShowHelpSwap   ;display instructions how to exchange cartridges
  80FF2C  ShowHelpNoSwap ;display instructions how to remove cartridges
  80FF30  DeleteFile     ;in: AL=first, AH=slot
  80FF34  TestSramId     ;in: AL=page, AH=slot, out: CY: 0=Used, 1=Free
  80FF38  SramToSramCopy ;in: AL=num, X=src, Y=dst; XH/YH=slot, XL/YL=first
Whereas,
  num = number of 2Kbyte pages
  slot = slot (0 or 1 for slot A or B)
  first = first 2Kbyte page number (of a file/area) (within selected slot)
  page = single 2Kbyte page number (within selected slot)
  addr = 24bit SNES memory address
  AL/AH, XL/XH, YL/YH = LSB/MSB of A,X,Y registers
The BIOS functions use first 16 bytes in WRAM [0000h..000Fh] for parameters,
return values, and internal workspace; when using BIOS functions, don't use
that memory for other purposes. [0000h] is NMI mode, don't change that even
when NOT using BIOS functions.

File/SRAM Functions
These functions may be (not very) helpful for managing SRAM, they are extremly
incomplete, there are no functions for creating files, or for searching
specific files. See the "Header" chapter for details on SRAM headers (again,
the BIOS doesn't create any headers or IDs, the game must fill-in all IDs,
Titles, and other values on its own).

Character Set
The BIOS ROM contains 4096 characters (each 16x16 pixel, aka 2x2 tiles). The
characters are stored at 1bit color depth in banks 04h..07h, offset 8000h-FFFFh
(20h bytes/character). The GetChar2bpp and GetChat4bpp functions can be used to
copy a selected character to WRAM, with bits in plane0, and the other plane(s)
zerofilled.

Help Functions
The two help functions are showing some endless repeated japanese instructions
about how to use, insert, remove, and exchange cartridges (similar to the
instructions shown when booting the BIOS without Game cartridges inserted). If
you have uploaded code to the APU, be sure to return control to the APU
boot-rom, otherwise the help functions will hang.

SNES Cart X-Band (2400 baud Modem)
----------------------------------

The X-Band is a 2400 baud modem from Catapult Entertainment Inc., licensed by
Nintendo, originally released 1994 in USA, and 199x? in Japan. Aside from the
SNES version, there have been also Genesis and Saturn versions.

--> SNES Cart X-Band Smart Card Reader
--> SNES Cart X-Band Rockwell Ports
--> SNES Cart X-Band Rockwell Notes
--> SNES Controllers X-Band Keyboard

Note
There's also another modem (which connects to controller port):
--> SNES Add-On SFC Modem (for JRA PAT)

SNES Cart X-Band Misc
---------------------

Info...
It was used for networked gaming via phone lines.
The Xband worked by sending controller instructions, by intercepting code from
the game, and patching it with its own instructions, much like the Game Genie
works. (that are, probably, two separate features messed into one sentence?)
The system worked by dialing up the main server, which was located in
Cupertino, California (USA), and somewhere else (Japan). The server then sent
the Xband newsletters (called Bandwidth and Xband News). It also sent any
patches that were needed. You could then search for opponents.

Unknown Features
There seems to be no CIC chip, so the BIOS does likewise work only with another
SNES cart connected.
There is switch, for whatever on/off/mode selection. There are three LEDs for
whatever purpose. And, there is some kind of a credit-card (or so) reader.

Memory Map
  D00000h-DFFFFFh  1MB ROM (executed here, not at C00000h-CFFFFFh)
  E00000h-E0FFFFh  64K SRAM (in two 32Kx8 chips) (unknown if BOTH have battery)
  FBC000h-FBC17Fh  I/O Ports (unknown functions?)
  FBC180h-FBC1BFh  I/O Ports (Rockwell Modem Chip)
  FBFC02h          I/O Port  (unknown functions?)
  FBFE00h          I/O Port  (unknown functions?)
  FFC000h          I/O Port  (unknown functions?)
  004F02h          I/O Port  (unknown functions?)
  00F000h          Dummy/strobe read?
  00FFE0h          Dummy/strobe read?
I/O Ports seem to be 8bit-wide / word-aligned (ie. one can use 8bit or 16bit
writes, with the MSB ignored in the latter case). Normally ONLY the even
addresses are used (some exceptions are: 8bit write 00h to FBC153h, 16bit write
0000h to FBC160h).
Some of the I/O ports outside of the FBCxxxh region might belong to other
hardware? (eg. the X-Band might automatically disable any Game Genie BIOS in
order to access the Game ROM).

Unknown 100pin Chip
Unknown. Probably controls the cart reader, the cheat/patching feature, and
maybe also memory & I/O mapping of the other chips.

Games supported by the X-Band modem
  Doom
  Ken Griffey Jr. Baseball
  Killer Instinct
  Madden NFL '95
  Madden NFL '96

  Mortal Kombat 3

  NHL '95
  NHL '96
  Super Mario Kart
  Weaponlord
and,
 Kirby's Avalanche
 Super Street Fighter II
 The Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past (secret maze game)
"First of all, the Legend of Zelda wasn't the only cartridge that would
activate the hidden maze game -- basically, any unsupported SNES cart would do
it. I usually used Super Mario World."
Most of the above games, don't include any built-in Xband support, instead,
Catapult reverse-engineered how they work, and patched them to work with the
modem. Exceptions are Weaponlord and Doom, which were released with "modem
support" (unknown what that means exactly... do they control modem I/O ports...
interact with the modem BIOS... or are they patched the same way as other
games, and the only difference is that the developers created the patches
before releasing the game?)
Note: The japanese BIOS does read the Game cartridge header several times
(unlike the US version which reads it only once), basically there is no good
reason for those multiple reads, but it might indicate the japanese version
includes multiple patches built-in in ROM?)

SNES Cart X-Band Smart Card Reader
----------------------------------

The X-Band contains a built-in Smart Card reader (credit card shaped chip cards
with 8 gold contacts). The X-Band BIOS contains messages that refer to "XBand
Cards" and "XBand Rental Cards". There aren't any photos (or other info) of
these cards in the internet, maybe X-Band requested customers to return the
cards, or the cards got lost for another reason.

Purpose
Not much known. Reportedly the card reader was used for Prepaid Cards (for
users whom didn't want Xband to charge the credit cards automatically), if that
is correct, then only those users would have received cards, and other users
didn't need to use the card reader? Note: The Options/Account Info screen show
entries "Account" and "Card".

Smart Card I/O Ports
The BIOS seems to be accessing the cards via these I/O ports:
  FBC100h Card Data/Control/Whatever (out)
  FBC108h.Bit0 (In) Card Switch (1=card inserted, 0=card missing)
  FBC108h.Bit1 (In) Card Data (input)
Related BIOS functions are function 0380h..0386h.

Unknown 64bit Number
The Xband BIOS is reading a 64bit number via serial bus (which may or may not
connect to the Smart Card) via two I/O Ports:
  FBC168h Data        ;bit2 (data, in/out)       ;\there is maybe also a reset
  FBC16Ah Direction   ;bit2 (0=input, 1=output)  ;/flag, eventually in bit5 ?
The sequence for reading the 64bits is somewhat like so:
  Data=Output(0), Delay (LOOPx01F4h)
  Data=Output(1), Delay (LOOPx01F4h)
  Data=Input
  wait until Data=1 or fail if timeout
  wait until Data=0 or fail if timeout
  wait until Data=1 or fail if timeout
  Delay (LOOPx02BCh)
  for i=1 to 4
    Data=Output(0), Delay (NOPx8)
    Data=Output(1), Delay (NOPx8)
    Data=Input, Delay (LOOPx0050h)
  for i=1 to 4
    Data=Output(0), Delay (NOPx8)
    Data=Output(1), Delay (LOOPx003Ch)
    Data=Input, Delay (LOOPx001Eh)
  Data=Input, Delay (LOOPx0064h)
  for i=0 to 63
    Data=Output(1), Delay (NOPx8)
    Data=Input, Delay (LOOPx000Ah)
    key.bit(i)=Data, Delay (LOOPx004Bh)
For the exact timings (Delays and other software overload), see the BIOS
function (at D7BE78h). Before doing the above stuff, the BIOS initializes
[FBC168h]=40h, [FBC16Ah]=FFh (this may be also required).
The 64bit number is received LSB first, and stored in SRAM at 3FD8h-3FDFh.
Whereas the last byte is a checksum across the first 7 bytes, calculated as so:
  sum=00h
  for i=0 to 55
    if (sum.bit(0) xor key.bit(i))=1 then sum=sum/2 xor 8Ch else sum=sum/2
For example, if the 7 bytes are "testkey", then the 8th byte must be 2Fh. Or,
another simplier example would be setting all 8 bytes to 00h.

SNES Cart X-Band Rockwell Ports
-------------------------------

Below are the I/O Ports of the Rockwell chip. In the SNES, Rockwell registers
00h-1Fh are mapped to EVEN memory addresses at FBC180h-FBC1BEh. The chip used
in the SNES supports data/voice modem functions (but not fax modem functions).

Rockwell didn't describe the CONF values in their RC96V24DP/RC2324DPL
datasheet, below CONF values are taken from a RC96DT/RC144DT datasheet (hoping
that the values are same, though the higher baudrates obviously won't work).

SNES Cart X-Band Rockwell Notes
-------------------------------

Configuration Changes
Various changes (to ASYNC, WDSZ, etc.) seem to be not immediately applied.
Instead, one must apply them by setting NEWC=1 by software (and then wait until
hardware sets NEWC=0).

Dialing
Dialing is done by setting CONF=81h, and then writing the telephone number
digits (range 00h..09h) to TBUFFER; before each digit wait for TDBE=1 (TX
buffer empty), the BIOS also checks for TONEA=1 before dialing.
The telephone number for the X-Band server is stored as ASCII string in the
BIOS ROM:
  "18002071194"  at D819A0h in US-BIOS (leading "800" = Toll-free?)
  "03-55703001"  at CE0AB2h in Japanese BIOS (leading "3" = Tokyo?)
Notes: Before dialing the above 'ASCII' numbers, the US-BIOS first dials
0Ah,07h,00h, and the japanese one first dials 01h. The "-" dash in the japanese
string isn't dialed.

Offline
There seems to be no explicit offline mode (in CONF register). Instead, one
must probably change the Relay A/B bits (RA/RB) to go online/offline.

SNES Cart FLASH Backup
----------------------

Most SNES games are using battery-backed SRAM for storing data, the only
exception - which do use FLASH memory - are the JRA PAT BIOS cartridges for the
SFC Modem:
--> SNES Add-On SFC Modem (for JRA PAT)
There are two JRA PAT versions, the older one (1997) supports only AMD FLASH,
the newer one (1999) supports AMD/Atmel/Sharp FLASH chips.
  ID=2001h - AM29F010 AMD (128Kbyte)      ;supported by BOTH bios versions
  ID=D51Fh - AT29C010A Atmel (128Kbyte)   ;supported only by newer bios version
  ID=32B0h - LH28F020SUT Sharp (256Kbyte?);supported only by newer bios version
The FLASH Size size defined in entry [FFBCh] of the Cartridge Header (this is
set to 07h in JRA PAT, ie. "(1K SHL 7)=128Kbytes").
There don't seem to be any data sheets for the Sharp LH28F020SUT-N80 chip (ID
B0h,32h) (so not 100% sure if it's really 256Kbytes), anyways, it does somehow
resemble LH28F020SU-N (5V, ID B0h,30h) and LH28F020SU-L (5V/3.3V, ID B0h,31h).

JRA PAT Memory Map
  80h-9Fh:8000h-FFFFh  ;1Mbyte LoROM (broken into 32 chunks of 32Kbytes)
  C0h-C3h:0000h-7FFFh  ;128Kbyte FLASH (broken into 4 chunks of 32Kbytes)

AMD FLASH

Get Device ID (Type 1 - AMD)
  [C05555h]=AAh, [C02AAAh]=55h, [C05555h]=90h           ;enter ID mode
  manufacturer=01h=[C00000h], device_type=20h=[C00001h] ;read ID (AM29F010)
  [C05555h]=AAh, [C02AAAh]=55h, [C05555h]=F0h           ;terminate command

Erase Entire Chip (Type 1 - AMD)
  [C05555h]=AAh, [C02AAAh]=55h, [C05555h]=80h           ;prepare erase
  [C05555h]=AAh, [C02AAAh]=55h, [C05555h]=10h           ;erase entire chip
  repeat, stat=[C00000h], until stat.bit7=1=okay, or stat.bit5=1=timeout

Erase 16Kbyte Sector (Type 1 - AMD)
  [C05555h]=AAh, [C02AAAh]=55h, [C05555h]=80h           ;prepare erase
  [C05555h]=AAh, [C02AAAh]=55h, [Cxx000h]=30h           ;erase 16kbyte sector
  repeat, stat=[Cxx000h], until stat.bit7=1=okay, or stat.bit5=1=timeout

Write Single Data Byte (Type 1 - AMD)
  [C05555h]=AAh, [C02AAAh]=55h, [C05555h]=A0h           ;write 1 byte command
  [Cxxxxxh]=dta                                         ;write the data byte
  repeat, stat=[Cxxxxxh], until stat.bit7=dta.bit7=okay, or stat.bit5=1=timeout

Notes
After AMD timeout errors, one should issue one dummy/status read from [C00000h]
to switch the device back into normal data mode (at least, JRA PAT is doing it
like so, not too sure if that is really required/correct).

ATMEL FLASH

Get Device ID (Type 2 - Atmel)
  [C05555h]=AAh, [C02AAAh]=55h, [C05555h]=90h           ;enter ID mode
  manufacturer=1Fh=[C00000h], device_type=D5h=[C00001h] ;read ID (AT29C010A)
  [C05555h]=AAh, [C02AAAh]=55h, [C05555h]=F0h           ;terminate command

Erase Entire Chip (Type 2 - Atmel)
  [C05555h]=AAh, [C02AAAh]=55h, [C05555h]=80h           ;prepare erase
  [C05555h]=AAh, [C02AAAh]=55h, [C05555h]=10h           ;erase entire chip
  wait two frames (or check if bit6 toggles on each read from [C00000h])

Erase 16Kbyte Sector (Type 2 - Atmel)
  No such command (one can write data without erasing)
  (to simulate a 16K-erase: write 128 all FFh-filled 128-byte blocks)

Write 1..128 Data Bytes (within 128-byte boundary) (Type 2 - Atmel)
  [C05555h]=AAh, [C02AAAh]=55h, [C05555h]=A0h           ;write 1..128 byte(s)
  [Cxxxxxh+0..n]=dta[0..n]                              ;write the data byte(s)
  repeat, stat=[Cxxxxxh+n], until stat=dta[n]           ;wait last written byte

Notes
The JRA PAD functions do include a number of wait-vblank delays between various
ATMEL commands, that delays aren't shown in above flowcharts.

SHARP FLASH

Get Device ID (Type 3 - Sharp)
  [C00000h]=90h                                         ;enter ID mode

  repeat, stat=[C00000h], until stat.bit7=1             ;wait busy
  if stat.bit4=1 or stat.bit5=1 then [C00000h]=50h      ;error --> clear status
  [C00000h]=FFh                                         ;terminate command

Erase Entire Chip (Type 3 - Sharp)
  [C00000h]=A7h, [C00000h]=D0h                          ;erase entire chip

  [C00000h]=20h, [Cxx000h]=D0h                          ;erase 16kbyte sector
  repeat, stat=[C00000h], until stat.bit7=1             ;wait busy
  if stat.bit4=1 or stat.bit5=1 then [C00000h]=50h      ;error --> clear status
  [C00000h]=FFh                                         ;terminate command
  if failed, issue "Reset Protection", and retry

Write Single Data Byte (Type 3 - Sharp)

  repeat, stat=[C00000h], until stat.bit7=1             ;wait busy
  ;below error-check & terminate are needed only after writing LAST byte

original PAR only support 3 codes, but the PAR2 supports 255 and has a built-in
trainer for code searcher. There is also a PAR3, but the added features are
unknown.
  AAAAAADD  ;-address (AAAAAA) and data (DD)
Address can be a ROM, SRAM, or WRAM location. Patching cartridge memory (both
ROM and SRAM) is implemented by hardware (supported by PAR2-PAR3 only, not by
PAR1 or X-Terminator 1-2). Patching WRAM is done by software (rewriting the
values on each Vblank NMI). WRAM addresses must be specified as 7E0000h-7FFFFFh
(mirrors at nn0000h-nn1FFFh aren't recognized by the BIOSes).

PAR 7E000000 - Do nothing
This is the most important PAR code (required as padding value, since the GUI
doesn't allow to remove items from the code list):

PAR FE0000xx..FFFFFFxx - Pre-boot WRAM patch (PAR1 only)
Writes xx to the corresponding WRAM address at 7E0000h..7FFFFFh, this is done
only once, and it's done BEFORE starting the game (purpose unknown - if any).

PAR 00600000 - Disable Game's NMI handler (PAR3 only)
Disables the game's NMI handler (executes only the NMI handler of the PAR
BIOS).

PAR DEADC0DE - Special Multi-Byte Code Prefix (PAR2a/b and PAR3 only)
Allows to hook program code, this feature is rarely used.
  DEADC0DE  ;-prefix (often misspelled as "DEADCODE", with "O" instead "0")
  AAAAAANN  ;-address (AAAAAA) and number of following 4-byte groups (NN)
  DDEEFFGG  ;-first 4-byte group    (DD=1st byte, .. GG=4th byte)
  HHIIJJKK  ;-second 4-byte group   (HH=5th byte, .. KK=8th byte) (if any)
  ...       ;-further 4-byte groups (etc.)                        (if any)
The data portion (DD,EE,FF..) (max 62h*4 = 188h bytes) is relocated to SRAM (in
the PAR cartridge), and the ROM address AAAAAA is patched by a 4-byte "JMP
nnnnnn" opcode (doing a far jump to the address of the relocated SRAM code;
this would be at 006A80h in PAR3, at 006700h in PAR2a/b, and isn't supported in
PAR1). There seems to be no special action required when returning control to
the game (such like disabling the SRAM - if the hardware does support that at
all?) (or such actions are required only for HiROM games that have their own
SRAM at 6000h?) (or games are typically accessing SRAM at 306xxxh, so there is
no conflict with PAR memory at 006xxxh?).
One can use only one DEADC0DE at a time, and, when using it, there are some
more restrictions: On PAR2a/b one cannot use ANY other hardware/software
patches. On PAR3 one can keep using ONE hardware patch (and any number of
software patches).

PAR C0DEnn00 - Whatever (X-Terminator 2 only - not an official PAR code)
Somehow changes the NMI (and IRQ) handling of the X-Terminator 2, "nn" can be
00..06.

Game Genie Codes (Codemasters/Galoob)
  DDAA-AAAA  ;-encrypted data (DD) and encrypted/shuffled address (AA-AAAA)
Address can be a ROM, or SRAM location (internal WRAM isn't supported). To
decrypt the code, first replace the Genie Hex digits by normal Hex Digits:
  Genie Hex:    D  F  4  7  0  9  1  5  6  B  C  8  A  2  3  E
  Normal Hex:   0  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9  A  B  C  D  E  F
Thereafter, DD is okay, but AAAAAA still needs to be deshuffled:
  ijklqrst opabcduv wxefghmn   ;Genie Address (i=Bit23 ... n=Bit0)
  abcdefgh ijklmnop qrstuvwx   ;SNES Address (a=Bit23 ... x=Bit0)
Aside from being generally annoying, the encryption makes it impossible to make
codes like "Start in Level NN" (instead, one would need to make separate codes
for each level).
Game Genie codes can be reportedly also used with the Game Mage. And, the PAR3
includes a "CONV" button for converting Game Genie codes. When manually
decrypting them, Game Genie codes would also work on PAR2 (although the PAR2
won't allow to use five ROM patches at once).

Gold Finger / Goldfinger Codes (unknown who created this format)
These codes are rarely used, and there isn't much known about them. Reportedly,
they have been supported by "certain copiers" (unknown which ones... Super UFO,
and also copiers from Front Far East?).
  AAAAADDEEFFCCW  ;-Address (AAAAA), Data (DD,EE,FF), Checksum (CC), Area (W)
The Address is a ROM address, not a CPU address. Data can be 1-3 bytes, when
using less than 3 bytes, pad the EE,FF fields with "XX" (and treat them as zero
in the checksum calculation). Checksum is calculated as so:
  CC = A0h + AAAAA/10000h + AAAAA/100h + AAAAA + DD (+ EE (+ FF))
W tells the copier whether to replace the byte in the DRAM (ROM image) or the
SRAM (Saved game static RAM) of the copier:
  W=0  DRAM (ROM image) (reportedly also for W=2,8,A,C,F)
  W=1  SRAM (Saved game image)
The 5-digit address allows to access max 1Mbyte. The address is an offset
within the ROM-image (excluding any 200h-byte header). The first LoROM byte
would be at address 00000h. Some copiers are using interleaved HiROM images -
unknown if any such interleave is used on code addresses - if so, first HiROM
byte would be at "ROMsize/2" (in middle of ROM-image), otherwise it'd be at
00000h (at begin at ROM-image).
Note: It doesn't seem to be possible to enter "X" digits in all copiers. Double
Pro Fighter Q allows to enter "X".

Front Far East Codes (Front Far East)
Supported by Front Far East copiers (Super Magicom and/or Super Wild Card?).
This format is even less popular than the Gold Finger format.
  NNAAAAAADD..    Number of bytes (NN), Address (AAAAAA), Data (DD..)
Allows to change 1..36 bytes; resulting in a code length of 10..80 digits (to
avoid confusion with 14-digit Gold Finger codes, Front Far East wants Gold
Finger codes to be prefixed by a "G").
AAAAAA is a 24bit offset within the ROM-image (excluding any 200h-byte header).
As far as known, Front Far East didn't use interleaved ROM-images, so the
offset should be straight.

SNES Cart Cheat Devices - Game Genie
------------------------------------

Game Genie BIOS Versions
There are at least three BIOS versions, named "GENSRC", "K7", and "ed":
  "GENSRC"  32Kbytes LoROM, straight I/O addresses  CRC32=AC94F94Ah
  "K7"      32Kbytes LoROM, messy I/O addresses     CRC32=F8D4C303h
  "ed"      64Kbytes LoROM, messy I/O addresses     CRC32=58CBF2FEh
The names are stored at ROM-offset 7FE0h (aka SNES address 00FFE0h). Most of
the cartridge header contains garbage (no checksum, wrong ROM size, etc.), only
the 21-byte title field is (more or less) correct:
  "Game Genie      ",0,0,0,0,0   ;32K versions (GENSRC & K7)
  "Game Genie         Jo"        ;64K version (ed)
Note: All three versions support only 5 codes to be entered.

Game Genie I/O Ports
The "GENSRC" version uses quite straight I/O addresses, the "K7" and "ed"
versions have the addresses messed up (unused gaps between the codes, several
mirrors, of which, mirrors with address bit8 and bits16-23 all zero are having
address bit0 inverted).
  Version   "GENSRC"          "K7" & "ed"
  Control   W:008000h         W:xx8100h, W:008001h  ;ed: xx=00, K7: xx=FF
  CodeFlags R/W:008001h       R:FF8001h, W:008000h  ;bit 0-4 = enable code 1-5
  CodeMsb   R/W:008003h+N*4   R:FF8005h+N*6, W:008004h+N*6  ;\
  CodeMid   R/W:008004h+N*4   R:FF8006h+N*6, W:008007h+N*6  ; N=0-4 for
  CodeLsb   R/W:008005h+N*4   R:FF8007h+N*6, W:008006h+N*6  ; code 1-5
  CodeData  R/W:008006h+N*4   R:FF8008h+N*6, W:008009h+N*6  ;/
Other (accidently) used I/O addresses are: W:004017h (bugged joypad access),
and W:00FFEAh/00FFEBh (used in an attempt to install a bugged NMI handler with
RET instead of RETI opcode; the hardware is hopefully ignoring that attempt).

Control Register
Allows to select what is mapped to memory. Used values are:
  00h Select Game Genie BIOS
  02h Select Game Genie I/O Ports
  06h Select Game Cartridge
  07h Select Game Cartridge and keep it selected
This register is set to 00h on /RESET (warmboot & coldboot).

Code Flags Register
Used to enable the 5 codes:
  Bit0-4  Enable Code 1..5  (0=Disable, 1=Enable)
  Bit5-7  Should be zero
This register is set to 00h on initial power-up (coldboot), but kept intact on
/RESET (warmboot), allowing to restore the previously enabled codes.

CodeAddress/CodeData Registers (5*4 bytes)
Contains the 24bit address and 8bit data values (in decrypted form). The
registers are kept intact on /RESET (warmboot), allowing to restore the
previously entered codes - however, when restoring the codes, the "K7" and "ed"
BIOS versions are ORing the LSB of of the 24bit address value with 01h, thereby
destroying all codes with even addresses (unknown why that's been done).

Chipset
The exact chipset is unknown, there should be the ROM and some logic (and no
SRAM). There is also a LED and a 2-position (?) switch (unknown function).

Game Genie 2 (prototype)
There is also an unreleased Game Genie 2 prototype, the thing includes a small
LCD screen, five push buttons, four LEDs, battery backed SRAM, a 8255 PIO, a
huge ACTEL chip, and some expansion connectors.

SNES Cart Cheat Devices - Pro Action Replay I/O Ports
-----------------------------------------------------

PAR1 I/O Ports (W)
  008000h                  ;Code 0-3 (MID) (shared for code 0..3)
  010000h,010001h,010002h  ;Code 0 (DTA,LSB,MSB) (not used by BIOS)
  010003h                  ;Control (set to FFh)
  010004h,010005h,010006h  ;Code 1 (DTA,LSB,MSB) (not used by BIOS)
  010007h,010008h,010009h  ;Code 2 (DTA,LSB,MSB) (used as NMI vector.LSB)
01000Ah,01000Bh,01000Ch  ;Code 3 (DTA,LSB,MSB) (used as NMI vector.MSB)
Most I/O ports are overlapping WRAM in bank 01h (unlike PAR2-PAR3 which use
bank 10h). The four code registers would allow to apply 4 hardware patches, the
PAR1 BIOS actually has provisions for doing that, but, before applying those
patches it erases code 0-3 (and does then use code 2-3 for patching the NMI
vector at 00FFEAh for applying the codes as WRAM software patches).
The PAR1 supports only LoROM addresses (address bit15 removed, and bit23-16
shifted down). The PAR1 does not (maybe cannot) disable unused codes; instead,
it directs them to an usually unused ROM location at 00FFF6h (aka 007FF6h after
removing bit15). Applying the codes is done in order DTA,MID,LSB,MSB, whereof,
the "shared" MID value is probably applied on the following LSB port write.
The control register is set to FFh before starting the game, purpose is unknown
(maybe enable the codes, or write-protect them, or disable the BIOS ROM; in
case that can be done by software).

PAR2 I/O Ports (W)
  100000h,100001h,100002h,100003h  ;Code 0 (DTA,LSB,MID,MSB) (code 0)
  100004h,100005h,100006h,100007h  ;Code 1 (DTA,LSB,MID,MSB) (code 1)
  100008h,100009h,10000Ah,10000Bh  ;Code 2 (DTA,LSB,MID,MSB) (code 2/NMI.LSB)
  10000Ch,10000Dh,10000Eh,10000Fh  ;Code 3 (DTA,LSB,MID,MSB) (code 3/NMI.MSB)
  100010h      ;Control A (set to 00h or FFh)
  C0A00nh      ;Control B (address LSBs n=0..7) (written data=don't care)
The registers overlapping the WRAM area are similar as for PAR1. The PAR2 BIOS
allows to use the code registers for ROM patches (and/or hooking the NMI
handler for WRAM patches).
Similar as in PAR1, address bit23-16 are shifted down, but with bit15 being
moved to bit23 (still a bit messy, but HiROM is now supported). Unused codes
are redirected to 00FFF6h (aka 807FF6h after moving bit15).
The control register is set to FFh before starting the game, purpose is unknown
(maybe enable the codes, or write-protect them, or disable the BIOS ROM; in
case that can be done by software).
The lower address bits of the newly added C0A00nh Register are:
  Address bit0 - set if one or more codes use bank 7Fh..FEh
  Address bit1 - set/cleared for PAL/NTSC selection (or vice-versa NTSC/PAL?)
  Address bit2 - set to... maybe, forcing the selection in bit1 (?)
The exact purpose of that three bits is unknown (and their implemention in
PAR2a/b BIOSes looks bugged). Doing anything special on bank 7Fh-FEh doesn't
make any sense, maybe the programmer wanted to use banks 80h-FFh, but that
wouldn't make much more sense either; it might be something for
enabling/disabling memory mirrors or so. The default PAL/NTSC flag is
auto-detected by reading 213Fh.Bit4 (the BIOS is doing that detection twice,
with opposite results on each detection, which seems to be a bug), the flag can
be also manually changed in the BIOS menu; purpose of the PAL/NTSC thing is
unknown... maybe directing a transistor to shortcut D4 to GND/VCC when games
are reading 213Fh.

PAR3 I/O Ports
  100000h,100001h,100002h,100003h  ;Code 0 (DTA,LSB,MID,MSB) (code 0)
  100004h,100005h,100006h,100007h  ;Code 1 (DTA,LSB,MID,MSB) (code 1)
  100008h,100009h,10000Ah,10000Bh  ;Code 2 (DTA,LSB,MID,MSB) (code 2)
  10000Ch,10000Dh,10000Eh,10000Fh  ;Code 3 (DTA,LSB,MID,MSB) (code 3)
  100010h,100011h,100012h,100013h  ;Code 4 (DTA,LSB,MID,MSB) (code 4)
  100014h,100015h,100016h,100017h  ;Code 5 (DTA,LSB,MID,MSB) (always NMI.LSB)
  100018h,100019h,10001Ah,10001Bh  ;Code 6 (DTA,LSB,MID,MSB) (always NMI.MSB)
  10001Ch         ;Control A    (bit4,6,7)
  10001Dh-10001Fh ;Set to zero  (maybe accidently, trying to init "code 7")
  10003Ch         ;Control B    (set to 01h upon game start)
  086000h         ;Control LEDs (bit0,1)
  206000h         ;Control C    (bit0)
  008000h         ;Control D    (set to 00h upon PAR-NMI entry)
Control A (10001Ch):
  Bit0-3 Should be 0
  Bit4   ROM Mapping (0=Normal, 1=Temporarily disable BIOS & enable GAME ROM)
  Bit5   Should be 0
  Bit6-7 Select/force Video Type (0=Normal, 1=NTSC, 2=PAL, 3=Reserved)
Control LEDs (086000h) (LEDs are in sticker area on front of cartridge):
  Bit0   Control left or right LED? (0=on or off?, 1=off or on?)
  Bit1   Control other LED          ("")
  Bit2-7 Should be 0
Control C (206000h):
  Bit0   Whatever (0=BIOS or PAR-NMI Execution, 1=GAME Execution)
  Bit1-7 Should be 0
Code0-6:
Unused codes are set to 00000000h (unlike PAR1/PAR2), and, codes use linear
24bit addresses (without moving/removing bit15). Of the seven codes, code 5-6
are always used for hooking the NMI handler (even when not using any WRAM
software patches), so one can use max 5 hardware ROM patches.

SNES Cart Cheat Devices - Pro Action Replay Memory
--------------------------------------------------

PAR1-PAR3 SRAM
All PAR versions contain 32Kbytes SRAM, divided into 8K chunks, which are
unconventionally mapped to EVEN bank numbers.
  00/02/04/06:6000h..7FFFh      ;-32Kbyte SRAM (four 8K banks)
The SRAM is used as internal workspace (stack & variables, code list, NMI
handler, deadcode handler, and list of possible-matches for the code finder).
Unknown if the SRAM is battery backed (the way how it is used by the BIOS
suggests that it is NOT battery backed).
Note: Many HiROM games have their own SRAM mapped to 6000h-7FFFh, unknown
if/how/when the PAR can disable its SRAM for compatibility with such games
(PAR1 seems to be designed for LoROM games only, but newer PAR2-PAR3 <should>
have HiROM support - if so, then the hardware must somehow switch the SRAM
on/off depending on whether it executes game code, or PAR code like NMI &
deadcode handlers).

PAR1-PAR3 Switch
All PAR versions do have a 3-position switch (on the right edge of the
cartridge). The way how Datel wants it to be used seems to be:
  1) Boot game with switch in MIDDLE position (maybe needed only for testing)
  2) Set LOWER position & push RESET button (to enter the BIOS menu)
  3) After selecting codes/cheat finder, start game with MIDDLE position
  4) Finally, UPPER position enables codes (best in-game, AFTER intro/menu)
Technically, the switch seems to work like so:
  UPPER Position   "Codes on"    Enable GAME and enable codes
  MIDDLE Position  "Codes off"   Enable GAME and disable codes
  LOWER Position   "Trainer On"  Enable BIOS and (maybe) enable codes
The "Codes off" setting may be required for booting some games (which may use
WRAM for different purposes during intro & game phases). The purpose of the
"Trainer" setting is unclear, GAME/BIOS mapping could be as well done via I/O
ports (and at least PAR3 does actually have such a feature for reading the GAME
header during BIOS execution).
There seems to be no I/O ports for sensing the switch setting, however, the
"Codes off" setting can be sensed by testing if the patches (namely the patched
NMI vector) are applied to memory or not.

PAR BIOS Versions
  Pro Action Replay Mk1 v2.1  1992        32K CRC32=81A67556h
  Pro Action Replay Mk2 v1.0  1992,93     32K CRC32=83B1D39Eh
  Pro Action Replay Mk2 v1.1  1992,93,94  32K CRC32=70D6B036h
  Pro Action Replay Mk3 v1.0U 1995       128K CRC32=0D7F770Ah
The two Mk2 versions are 99.9% same (v1.1 is only 10 bytes bigger than v1.0,
major change seems to be the copyright message).
Aside from v1.0/v1.1, there are reportedly further PAR2 BIOS versions (named
v2.P, v2.T, v2.H). Moreover, there's reportedly at least one localized BIOS (a
german PAR3 with unknown version number).

PAR Component List
The exact component list is all unknown. Some known components are:
  PAR1-3  3-position switch (on right edge of the cartridge)
  PAR1-3  32Kbytes SRAM (probably not battery-backed)
  PAR1-2  32Kbytes BIOS
  PAR3    128Kbytes BIOS (with modernized GUI and built-in "PRESET" codes)
  PAR1    46pin cartridge slot (incompatible with coprocessors that use 62pins)
  PAR2-3  62pin cartridge slot
  PAR2-3? second Npin cartridge slot at rear side (for CIC from other region)
  PAR3    two LEDs (within sticker-area on front of cartridge)
  PAR1-3  whatever logic chip(s)

SNES Cart Cheat Devices - X-Terminator & Game Wizard
----------------------------------------------------

Pro Action Replay (PAR1) clone
Wide parts of the X-Terminator BIOS are copied 1:1 from a disassembled PAR1
BIOS. The similarities begin at the entrypoint (with some entirely useless
writes to 2140h-2143h), and go as far as using the ASCII characters "W H B ."
as default dummy data values for the 4 codes (the initials of the PAR1
programmer W.H.BECKETT). There are some differences to the original PAR1: The
hardware and I/O ports are a custom design, the GUI does resemble the PAR2
rather than the PAR1, and english words like "relation" are translated to odd
expressions like "differentship". Nonetheless, the thing was called back (in
some countries at least), presumably due to all too obvious copyright
violations.

I/O Ports & Memory Map

  00,02,04,06:6000-7FFF  00-1F:02C00-2FFF     ;SRAM (32Kbytes)
Note: Both BIOS versions are confusingly using 16bit writes to the I/O ports in
some cases; the LSB-write to [addr+0] has no effect (or lasts only for 1 cpu
cycle), the MSB-write to [addr+1] is the relevant part.
The uncommon SRAM mapping in EVEN banks at 6000h-7FFFh was cloned from PAR. The
later mapping to 2C00h-2FFFh was probably invented for compatibility with HiROM
games that use 6000h-7FFFh for their own SRAM (or possibly just to look less
like a PAR clone).
Aside from NMI, the X-Terminator 2 is also using IRQ vectors (though unknown if
they are used only during BIOS execution or also during GAME execution, in
latter case reads from FFEEh would probably also trigger memory mapping).

Game Wizard (by Innovation)
The Game Wizard seems to be a rebadged X-Terminator. Unknown if the I/O
addresses are same as for X-Terminator 1 or 2.

BIOS Versions
There are at least two versions:
  X-Terminator    1993 (english)  (CRC32=243C4A53h) (no built-in codes)
  X-Terminator 2  19xx (japanese) (CRC32=5F75CE9Eh) (codes for 307 games)
There should be probably also a separate version for Game Wizard. And,
considering that the BIOS is stored on ERPOM, there might be many further
versions & revisions.
Cartridge header is FFh-filled (except for exception vectors), BIOS is 32Kbytes
LoROM.

X-Terminator Expansion ROMs
There have been at least 5 expansion cartridges released:
  Parame ROM Cassette Vol 1-5 (by Game Tech)
The cartridges contain 256Kbytes LoROM, and they can be used in two ways:
As normal executable (via normal ROM header at ROM-offset 7FC0h aka SNES
address 00FFC0h), or as cheat-code database extension for the X-Terminator 2
(via a special ROM header at ROM-offset 10000h aka SNES address 028000h).
  028000h - ID "FU O9149" (aka "UFO 1994" with each 2 bytes swapped)
  028008h - Boot callback (usually containing a RETF opcode)
  028010h - List of 16bit pointers (80xxh-FFFFh), terminated by 0000h
The 16bit pointers do address following structures (in ROM bank 02h):
  2   checksum (MSB,LSB) taken from GAME cartridge ROM header [FFDCh]
  1   number of following 5-byte codes (N)
  5*N codes (MID,MSB,DTA,LSB,TYPE)  ;TYPE=predefined description (00h..23h)
Unknown how the cartridges are intended to be connected (between X-Terminator
and Game cartridge... or maybe to a separate expansion slot).

Super UFO Copier
The Super UFO copiers are somehow closely related to X-Terminator (probably
both made by the same company). X-Terminator codes are supported by various
Super UFO versions. Later Super UFO versions also include/support Parame
expansion ROMs:
  Super UFO Pro-8 V8.8c BIOS
This versions seems to detect "FU O9149" IDs (ie. Parame carts), moreover, it
seems to include it's own "FU O9149" ID (but, strangely, at 048000h instead of
028000h, so the X-Terminator won't find it?).

X-Terminator Chipset (whatever X-Terminator version)
  Goldstar GM76C256ALL-70 (32Kbytes SRAM, not battery-backed)
  D27256 (32Kbytes UV-Eraseable EPROM)
  two logic chips & two PALs or so (part numbers not legible on existing photo)
  3-position switch (on PCB solder-side) (SCAN/NORMAL/ACTION)
  two cartridge slots (for PAL and NTSC cartridges or so)

SNES Cart Cheat Devices - Game Saver
------------------------------------

The Game Saver from Nakitek allows to load/save snapshots of (most of) the SNES
memory and I/O ports.

Game Saver Controls (works with joypad in port 1 only)
  L+R       upon boot --> test screen / version number
  L+R+START upon boot --> toggle slow DRAM checksumming on/off
  SELECT    in title  --> enter revival codes
  R+SELECT  in game   --> save state
  L+SELECT  in game   --> load state
  R+START   in game   --> toggle slow motion on/off  ;\one of these keeps
  L+START   in game   --> toggle slow motion on/off  ;/HDMA enabled (or so)

Missing Save Data
The SNES cannot directly access the APU, so APU RAM, DSP I/O Ports, and SPC700
registers aren't saved. The WRAM address (2181h-2183h) isn't saved. The
VRAM/OAM/CGRAM addresses are saved (but may have wrong values since the
autoincrement isn't handled). Any coprocessor I/O ports or cartridge SRAM
aren't saved.

Hardware Versions (Game Saver and Game Saver+)
The original Game Saver didn't have any power supply, which made (and still
makes) it the most controverse SNES add-on: Some people just like it, other
people are crying tears because they don't understand why the DRAM isn't
battery-backed.
This has led to the creation of the Game Saver Plus - a surreal product that
<does> use battery-backed DRAM (according to the booklet, where it is called
"portability" feature, six new AA batteries last 8-10 hours). Aside from
batteries, the Game Saver Plus is powered via the 9V DC supply of NTSC-SNES
consoles (even when the console itself is switched off). That's allowing to
switch off the SNES during supper in order to "save" energy (though after some
weeks, the permanently powered DRAM may negate that energy "saving" effect).

BIOS Versions
There seem to be several BIOS versions (DDMMYY formatted date and version
number are shown in the test screen). Known versions are:
  Game Saver v1.3 (19xx)
  Game Saver v1.7 (31 Jul 1995)
Unknown if Game Saver & Game Saver Plus use different BIOSes. Unknown if any
new/changed I/O ports were invented alongside with the BIOS versions.

Game Saver Memory and I/O Map
  002100h-0021xxh PPU ports (logged at 2081xxh) (or at 2080xxh on 2nd write)
  004200h-0042xxh CPU ports (logged at 2082xxh)
  008000h-00FFFFh BIOS ROM 32Kbytes
  0080xFh         Switch to GAME mapping (upon opcodes that end at 80xFh)
  00FFEAh         Switch to BIOS mapping (upon NMI execution; when enabled)
  108000h-108001h I/O - First/second write flags for write-twice PPU ports
  108002h-108003h I/O - Exception Mode/Status (bit0-1=BRK, bit2=NMI)
  208000h-2087FFh SRAM 2Kbytes (includes auto-logged writes to PPU/CPU ports)
  400000h-73FFFFh DRAM 256Kbytes (for saving WRAM/VRAM/OAM/CGRAM, CPU/DMA regs)
  808000h-80FFFFh GAME ROM (even while BIOS mapping is enabled)
The Game Saver can trap BRK or NMI exceptions. Of which, BIOS v1.7 seems to use
only BRKs (which are probably generated by outputting a 00h opcode in response
to joypad access, ie. [4218h] reads and [4017h]=01h writes).

Game Saver Revival Codes
The 5-digit "Revival Codes" are used to improve compatibility with different
games. Most commonly used are 2xxxx codes, which cause a byte in WRAM to be
left unchanged when loading data (probably in order to keep the Main CPU aware
of the state of the APU). The Code Format is:
  00000-0FFFF Blank (no action) (shown as "XXXXX" in GUI)
  10000-1FFFF Exception Mode (value for [108002]) (not used for any games)
  20000-3FFFF Preserve WRAM byte at 7E0000-7FFFFF (used for most games)
  40000-4FFFF PPU write-twice related     (used only for Starfox/Star Wing)
  50000-5FFFF PPU write-twice related     (not used for any games)
  60000-6FFFF Reserved (no action)        (not used for any games)
  70000-7FFFF Select special BRK handler  (used only for Aero the Acro Bat)
  80000-9FFFF Preserve WRAM byte at 7E0000-7FFFFF and pass it to 2140h ;\not
  A0000-BFFFF Preserve WRAM byte at 7E0000-7FFFFF and pass it to 2141h ; used
  C0000-DFFFF Preserve WRAM byte at 7E0000-7FFFFF and pass it to 2142h ; by any
  E0000-FFFFF Preserve WRAM byte at 7E0000-7FFFFF and pass it to 2143h ;/games
Codes (and updates) have been available as print-outs from Nakitek (the list
from 1995 contains codes for around 200 games; to be entered when pressing
SELECT in title screen). Moreover some (or all) BIOSes contain automatically
applied built-in codes (via checksumming portions of the game ROM header). The
v1.7 BIOS contains 284 codes (however, the code list does (maybe accidently)
contain an entry with NULL checksum, which causes the last 108 codes to be
ignored).

Component List (Game Saver Plus)
  24pin SRAM (2Kbytes) (probably used only because DRAM is too slow for I/O)
  28pin ROM/EPROM (32Kbytes)
  62pin cartridge slot (on rear side of device)
  14pin eight DRAM chips (256Kbytes in total)
  Xpin huge chip (whatever logic)
  3pin 7805 or so (for turning much of the 9 volts into heat)
  2pin oscillator (20.000MHz) (for DRAM refresh generator when power-off)
  socket/cable/plug for NTSC-SNES 9V DC supply (not PAL-SNES 9V AC supply)
  battery box for six 1.5V AA batteries, battery LED, and battery switch
  resistors, capacitors, and maybe diodes, transistors

Note
Some Copiers include a similar feature, allowing to load/save "real time saves"
on floppy disks and/or temporarily in unused portions of their built-in DRAM.

SNES Cart Cheat Devices - Theory
--------------------------------

ROM Patches
There are two possible ways for patching ROMs or ROM-images:
  1) rewrite ROM-image in RAM once before game starts        (GF/FFE/emulators)
  2) patch on ROM reading (by watching address bus)          (GG and PAR2-3)
Both are basically having same results, there may be some variations concerning
memory mirrors (depending on how the ROM-image in RAM is mirrored, or on how
the GG/PAR2-3 do decode the ROM address).

WRAM Patches
Implemented by rewriting WRAM upon NMI, variations would involve mirrors:
  1) allow WRAM addresses 7E0000-7FFFFF                      (PAR1-3, XT1-2)
  2) allow WRAM addresses 7E0000-7FFFFF and nn0000-nn1FFF    (N/A)

SRAM Patches
There are three possible ways for patching battery-backed SRAM:
  1) rewrite once before game starts                         (GF)
  2) patch on SRAM reading (like hardware based ROM patches) (GG and PAR2-3)
  3) rewrite repeatedly on NMI execution (like WRAM patches) (N/A)
SRAM is usually checksummed, so SRAM patches need to be usually combined with
ROM patches which do disable the checksum verification.

Slow Motion Feature
Implemented by inserting delays in Vblank NMI handler. The feature can be
usually configured in the BIOS menu, and/or controlled via joypad button
combinations from within NMI handler.

Cheat Finders (for WRAM Patches) (eventually also for SRAM patches)
Implemented by searching selected values from within Vblank NMI handler, or
more simple: from within BIOS RESET handler. The search can be enabled/disabled
mechanically via switch, or in some cases, via joypad button combinations. The
searched value can be configured on RESET, or in some cases, via joypad button
combinations.

Game Saver (Nakitek)
Allows to save a copy of WRAM/VRAM and I/O ports (but not APU memory) in DRAM,
done upon joypad button-combinations sensed within BRK/NMI exception handlers.

SNES Cart Tri-Star (aka Super 8) (allows to play NES games on the SNES)
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

The Tri-Star is an adaptor for playing NES games on the SNES (similar to the
Super Gameboy which allows to play Gameboy games on SNES). The thing have three
cartridge slots (two for western/japanese NES/Famicom cartridges, and one for
SNES cartridges).
NES or SNES mode can be selected in BIOS boot menu. SNES mode does simply
disable the BIOS and jump to game entrypoint at [FFFCh]. NES mode executes the
games via a NOAC (NES-on-a-Chip, a black blob, which is also used in various
other NES clones), in this mode, the SNES video signal is disabled, and, aside
from the BIOS passing joypad data to the NES, the SNES does merely serve as
power-supply for the NES.

Memory and I/O Map
  00E000h-00FFFFh.R - BIOS ROM (8Kbytes)
  00FFF0h.W - NES Joypad 1 (8bit data, transferred MSB first, 1=released)
  00FFF1h.W - NES Joypad 2 (bit4-5: might be NES reset and/or whatever?)
  00FFF2h.W - Enter NES Mode (switch to NES video signal or so)
  00FFF3h.W - Disable BIOS and map SNES cartridge

Joypad I/O
In NES mode, the BIOS is reading SNES joypads once per frame (via automatic
reading), and forwards the first 8bit of the SNES joypad data to the NES
(accordingly, it will work only with normal joypads, not with special hardware
like multitaps or lightguns). Like on japanese Famicoms, there are no
Start/Select buttons transferred to joypad 2. Instead, FFF1h.Bit5/4 are set to
Bit5=0/Bit4=1 in SNES mode, and to Bit5=1/Bit4=0 in NES mode (purpose is
unknown, one of the bits might control NES reset signal, the other might select
NES/SNES video signal, unless that part is controlled via FFF3h).

Mode Selection I/O
When starting a NES/SNES game, ports FFF2h or FFF3h are triggered by writing
twice to them (probably writing any value will work, and possibly writing only
once might work, too).

BIOS Versions (and chksum, shown when pressing A+X on power-up)
  Tri-Star (C) 1993                        ;ROM CHKSUM: 187C
  Tri-Star Super 8 by Innovation (C) 1995  ;ROM CHKSUM: F61E
Both BIOSes are 8Kbytes in size (although ROM-images are often overdumped). The
versions seem to differ only by the changed copyright message. The GUI does
resemble that of the X-Terminator and Super UFO (which were probably made by
the same anonymous company).
A third version would have been the (unreleased) Superdeck (a similar device
that has been announced by Innovation and some other companies).

SNES Cart Pirate X-in-1 Multicarts
----------------------------------

There are several X-in-1 Multicarts, all containing the same type of text based
GUI, and thus probably all made by the same company.

Cartridge Header
The first 4 bytes of the title string at FFC0h do usually (or always) contain
values 5C,xx,xx,80 (a "JMP FAR 80xxxxh" opcode, which jumps to the GAME
entrypoint). The next 4 title bytes are sometimes containing another JMP FAR
opcode, the rest of the header is unmodified header of the first game; except
that [FFFCh] contains the MENU entrypoint.

ROM-images
ROM-images found in the internet are usually incomplete dumps, containing only
the first 4MBytes (clipped to the maximum size for normal unmapped LoROM
games), or only the first game (clipped to the ROM size entry of the 1st game
header). Whilst, the actual multicarts are usually 8MBytes in size (there's one
4Mbyte cartridge, which is actually fully dumped).

ROM Size
Most cartridges seem to contain 8Mbyte ROMs. There is one 4MByte cartridge. And
there's one cartridge that contains an 8Kbyte EPROM (plus unknown amount of
ROM).

LoROM/HiROM
Most games seem to be LoROM. Eventually "Donkey Kong Land 3" is HiROM? Unknown
if HiROM banks can be also accessed (dumped) in LoROM mode, and if so, unknown
how they are ordered; with/without 32Kbyte interleave...?

SRAM
According to photos, most or all X-in-1 carts do not contain any SRAM. Though
some might do so?

DSPn
According to photos, most or all X-in-1 carts do not contain any DSP chips.
Though the "Super 11 in 1" cartridge with "Top Gear 3000" seems to require a
DSP4 clone?

Port FFFFxxh
  A0-A3 Bank Number bit0-3 (base offset in 256Kbyte units)
  A4    Bank Number bit4 (or always one in "1997 New 7 in 1")
  A5    Always 0         (or Bank bit4 in "1997 New 7 in 1")
  A6    Varies (always 0, or always 1, or HiROM-flag in "Super 7 in 1")
  A7    Always 1 (maybe locks further access to the I/O port)
The bank number is somehow merged with the SNES address. As for somehow: This
may be ORed, XORed, or even ADDed - in most cases OR/XOR/ADD should give the
same result; in case of "1997 New 7 in 1" it looks as if it's XORed(?)
The special meaning of A4-A5 can be detected by sensing MOV [FFFFnn],A opcodes
(rather than normal MOV [FFFF00+x],A opcodes).
The special meaning of A6 can be detected by checking if the selected bank
contains a HiROM-header.

Port 6FFFxxh
Unknown. Some games write to both FFFFxxh and 6FFFxxh (using same data &
address LSBs for both ports). Maybe the ROM bank address changed to 6FFFxxh on
newer boards, and FFFFxxh was kept in there for backwards compatibility. Or
maybe 6FFFxxh controls SRAM mapping instead ROM mapping?

X-in-1 Cartridges
  Title               FFFFxx      6FFFxx    Size/Notes
  8 in 1 and 10 in 1  C0-DF       N/A       8MB (8 big games + 10 mini games?)

DRAM mapping (LoROM/HiROM), and corresponding SRAM mapping are selected via
(sharing) Bit0-1 of the Parallel Data Output (Port C008h.W)
HiROM/Mode 21:
  Even DRAM Bank is mapped to bb0000-bb7FFF.
  Odd DRAM Bank is mapped to  bb8000-bbFFFF.
Optionally, banks 20-5F and A0-DF can be mapped to CART instead of DRAM (via
E00Dh), probably intended to allow ROM-images in DRAM to access DSP chips in
CART.

BIOS Notes
Observe that the BIOS is divided into 8Kbyte banks (so, the exception vectors
are at offset 1Fxxh in the ROM-image) (however, there are some overdumped
ROM-images that contain 24K padding prior to each 8K ROM-bank, ie. with LoROM
mapping style exception vectors at offset 7Fxxh). Aside from the exception
vectors, there isn't any title, nor other valid cartridge header entries.
Note: Unlike most SNES programs, Magicom & Wild Card (until v1.8) BIOSes are
running in 6502 emulation mode (with E=1), rather than 65C816 mode (with E=0).

Parallel Port Protocol (on SNES side)
Data is received via 8bit data register, and sent via 4bit "status" register
(which is seen as status on PC side). Strobe/busy aren't clearly documented in
official Front specs; probably, Busy gets set automatically when sensing Strobe
(from PC side), and gets cleared automatically when reading Data from Port
C008h (on SNES side).

Parallel Port Protocol (on PC side)
Byte Output Procedure:
  Wait Busy Bit = 1           ;Status  PC Port 379h/279h/3BDh.Bit7
  Write One Byte              ;Data    PC Port 378h/278h/3BCh.Bit0-7
  Reverse Strobe Bit          ;Control PC Port 37Ah/27Ah/3BEh.Bit0
Byte Input Procedure:
  Wait Busy Bit = 0           ;Status  PC Port 379h/279h/3BDh.Bit7
  Read Low 4 Bits of Byte     ;Status  PC Port 379h/279h/3BDh.Bit3-6
  Reverse Strobe Bit          ;Control PC Port 37Ah/27Ah/3BEh.Bit0
  Wait Busy Bit = 0           ;Status  PC Port 379h/279h/3BDh.Bit7
  Read High 4 Bits of Byte    ;Status  PC Port 379h/279h/3BDh.Bit3-6
  Reverse Strobe Bit          ;Control PC Port 37Ah/27Ah/3BEh.Bit0
Receiving 4bit units via status line is done for compatibility with old
one-directional PC parallel (printer) ports.
Unknown if "Wait Busy Bit = X" means to wait while-or-until Bit=X?

Parallel Port Command Format
Commands are 9-bytes in length, sent from PC side.
  00h 3   ID (D5h,AAh,96h)
  03h 1   Command Code (00h-01h, or 04h-06h)
  04h 2   Address (LSB,MSB)
  06h 2   Length (LSB,MSB)
  08h 1   Checksum (81h XORed by Bytes 03h..07h)
  Followed by <Length> bytes of data (upload/download commands only)
Commands can be:
  Command 00h : Download Data (using page:address,length)   ;to-or-from PC?
  Command 01h : Upload Data (using page:address,length)     ;from-or-to PC?
  Command 04h : Force SFC Program to JMP (to address... plus page/bank?)
  Command 05h : Select 8Kbyte Memory Page Number (using address)
  Command 06h : Sub Function (address: 0=InitialDevice: 1=ExecDRAM, 2=ExecCART)
InitialDevice does probably reset the BIOS? ExecDRAM allows to run the uploaded
ROM-image, but unknow how to select LoROM/HiROM mode, or is it automatically
done by examining the uploaded cartridge header. The usage of the 16bit address
isn't quite clear: The lower 13bit are somehow combined with the 8Kbyte page
number, the upper 3bit might be used to select DRAM/SRAM?

Super Magicom V3H - BIOS upgrade
This ROM-image is a Magicom BIOS upgrade, and it's a pain in the ass:
The upgrade works ONLY as ROM-image (ie. must be loaded to DRAM), and does NOT
work as real ROM (ie. cannot be burned to EPROM), the reason is that it doesn't
include a character set (and uses that from the original Magicom BIOS at
E000h).
The upgrade isn't compatible with the parallel port (the original BIOS
relocates parallel port code from ROM to WRAM, and the upgrade relocates itself
from DRAM to WRAM - but still expects the parallel port code in the same WRAM
location and crashes when Busy-bit gets set).
The upgrade exists as 32Kbyte or 32.5Kbyte ROM-image (an 8K upgrade, 24K
garbage with entrypoint at end of garbage, plus 0.5K extra garbage), emulators
and other tools will be typically interprete the 32.5K file as 32Kbyte ROM with
512-byte header (which is NOT correct in that special case).
The upgrade exists in two variants: One using the standard Front Fareast I/O
addresses, one using the I/O addresses at C000h-C00Fh re-ordered as so:
  8000h-FFFFh RW DRAM-mode: DRAM (containing the Magicom V3H upgrade)
  E000h-FFFFh R  BIOS-mode: BIOS (containing the Character set)
  C000h       W  DRAM bank mapped to 8000h? (set to 00,20,40 upon DRAM detect)
  C001h       W  Memory Control?
  C002h       -  Unused
  C003h       R  Parallel Port Busy (bit7) (when set: crashes the V3H upgrade)
  C004h-C008h -  Unused
  C009h       R  Status (bit7=ready?,bit5=busy/timeout?)
  C00Ah       -  FDC Unused
  C00Bh       W  FDC Motor Control (set to 00h,29h,2Dh)
  C00Ch       RW FDC Command/Data
  C00Dh       R  FDC Main Status
  C00Eh       W  FDC Transfer Rate? (set to 00h,01h,02h or so)
  C00Fh       -  FDC Unused
  E004h       W  Map BIOS ROM (instead V3H upgrade) ;\
  E006h-E007h W  Something on/off                   ; seems to be same/similar
  E008h-E009h W  Something on/off                   ; as Front-like I/O ports
  E00Ch-E00Dh W  Something on/off                   ;/
Unknown which hardware uses that re-ordered addresses. Note: The V3H version
with re-ordered I/O addresses does also contain different 24K garbage (sorts of
as if it were created from original source code, rather than just patched?).

SNES Cart Copiers - CCL (Supercom & Pro Fighter)
------------------------------------------------

Below is for Supercom Partner & Pro Fighter models from CCL (China Coach
Limited). See the Front Fareast chapter for their earlier Super Magicom models
(which were produced by Front & CCL), and also for Supercom Pro 2 (which was
made by CCL alone, but still used the Front-like I/O ports).

Pro Fighter 1993 by H.K. / Supercom Partner A
Ports are somewhat based on the Front design (BIOS is expanded from 8K at
E000h-FFFFh to 16K at C000h-FFFFh, accordingly FDC Ports C000h-C007h are moved
to 2800h-2807h, and Parallel Port Ports C008h-C009h are simply removed. Ports
at E00xh are somehow changed, but might be still similar to the Front design
(?)
  2800.R   FDC MCS General Purpose Input (bit7,bit6 used)
  2802.W   FDC MCS Motor Control (set to 00h,29h,2Dh)
  2804.R   FDC MCS Main Status
  2805.RW  FDC MCS Command/Data Status
  2807.W   FDC MCS Transfer Rate/Density (set to 0..3)
  Below 2808-2810 only in newer "Pro Fighter Q"

   2809.W   Parallel Port Data (4bit or 8bit?)
   2810.R   Parallel Port Busy (bit5)
    (there seem to be 4bit & 8bit parallel port modes supported, one of them
    also WRITING to 2808h, and in some cases reading "FDC" register 2800 looks
    also parallel port DATA and/or BUSY related)
  Again changed for Double Pro Fighter
   2803.R   Parallel Port Busy (bit7)
   2808.R   Parallel Port Data (bit0-7)
   2809.W   Parallel Port Data (4bit or 8bit?)

   014800    ROM (from offset A800-BFFF) (contains character set)
   E00x
   E800+x
   Note: Having BIOS portions mapped to the fast 3.58MHz region at 4800h-5FFFh
         was probably done unintentionally; this would require 120ns EPROMs,
         whilst some Double Pro Fighter boards are fitted with 200ns EPROMs
         (which are stable at 2.68MHz only, and may cause crashes, or charset
         glitches in this case)

SNES Cart Copiers - Misc
------------------------

Parallel Ports (DB-25)
Parallel Ports are used to upload/download data from PCs. Later copiers seem to
be additionally using the Parallel Port for connecting CD-ROM drives.
Some copiers have fully working parallel ports installed (eg. Front Fareast),
some have them incompletely installed (eg. some Supercom seem to require
additional 74LS245 (8-bit 3-state transceiver), and a specially programmed
PAL16V8 chip?).
Other copiers don't have any provisions for parallel ports onboard - but can be
eventually upgraded externally by plugging a parallel port cartridge into the
SNES cartridge slot: There are at least two such upgrade cartridges (one
contains pure logic, the other one additionally contains a BIOS upgrade).

DSP Chips
Some copiers include DSP-clones onboard (or do at least have sockets or
soldering points for mounting DSP chips), other copiers can be upgraded
externally: By plugging a DSP cartridge into the SNES cartridge slot (either a
regular game cartridge with DSP chip, or a plain DSP-clone-cartridge without
any game in it).
Of course, this will work only with the correct DSP chip (DSP1 for most games;
unless there are any DSP clones that support more than one DSP chip at one?).
Another problem may be I/O addresses (different games expect DSP chips at
different addresses).

Batteries
Some boards contain batteries for the internal SRAM. Either 3V Lithium cells
(coin-shaped), or rechargeable 3.6V NiCd batteries (usually with blue coating,
which tend to leak acid, and to destroy wires on the PCB). Other boards don't
have any batteries at all (they are said to use capacitors instead of
batteries, which might be nonsense, or might last only a few minutes?) (there
seems to be no way to switch-off the external power-supply, so batteries aren't
needed to power SRAM) (eventually some boards might even power the DRAM in
standby mode (?), which would require a DRAM refresh generator). And, aside
from battery-backup, most or all copiers are allowing to save SRAM to floppy.

One exception is the Multi Game Hunter (from Venus), which seems to use a
different (unknown) FDC chip.

FDC Address Decoding
The 68pin MCS3201FN chips include a 10bit address bus (for decoding address
3F0h-3F7h on IBM PCs; whereas, SNES copiers are using only the lower some
address bits), and an 8bit General Purpose Input. The 40pin/44pin GM82C765B
chips include a 1bit address bus bundled with 3 select lines, and have no
General Purpose Input register.
  GM82C765B   MCS3201FN  Dir  Register
  N/A         A0-A2=0    R    General Purpose Input (pins I0..I7)
  /LDOR       A0-A2=2    W    Motor Control (bit0-7)

  N/A         A0-A2=7    R    Bit7=DiskChange, Bit6-0=Zero
Accordingly, MCS3201FN ports are always ordered as shown above, whilst
GM82C765B ports can be arranged differently (in case of the Super Wild Card,
Front Fareast kept them arranged the same way as on their older Super Magicom).

which drive(s) it does apply.

SNES Cart Copiers - Floppy Disc NEC uPD765 Commands
---------------------------------------------------

Accessing the FDC 765
The Data Register is used to write Commands and Parameters, to read/write data
bytes, and to receive result bytes. These three operations are called Command-,
Execution-, and Result-Phase. The Main Status Register signalizes when the FDC
is ready to send/receive the next byte through the Data Register.

Command Phase
A command consists of a command byte (eventually including the MF, MK, SK
bits), and up to eight parameter bytes.

Execution Phase
During this phase, the actual data is transferred (if any). Usually that are
the data bytes for the read/written sector(s), except for the Format Track
Command, in that case four bytes for each sector are transferred.

Result Phase
Returns up to seven result bytes (depending on the command) that are containing
status information. The Recalibrate and Seek Track commands do not return
result bytes directly, instead the program must wait until the Main Status
Register signalizes that the command has been completed, and then it must (!)
send a Sense Interrupt State command to 'terminate' the Seek/Recalibrate
command.

Parameter/Result bytes are:
  HU  b0,1=Unit/Drive Number, b2=Physical Head Number, other bits zero
  TP  Physical Track Number
  TR  Track-ID (usually same value as TP)
  HD  Head-ID
  SC  First Sector-ID (sector you want to read)
  SZ  Sector Size (80h shl n) (default=02h for 200h bytes)
  LS  Last Sector-ID (should be same as SC when reading a single sector)

Format Track: output TR,HD,SC,SZ for each sector during execution phase
Read Track: reads NM sectors (starting with first sec past index hole)
Read ID: read ID bytes for current sec, repeated/undelayed read lists all IDs
Recalib: walks up to 77 tracks, 80tr-drives may need second recalib if failed
Seek/Recalib: All read/write commands will be disabled until succesful senseint
Senseint: Set's IC if unsuccesful (no int has occured) (until IC=0)

FDC Status Registers
The Main Status register can be always read through an I/O Port. The other four
Status Registers cannot be read directly, instead they are returned through the
data register as result bytes in response to specific commands.

Main Status Register (I/O Port)

  b2     HD  Head Address (pin 27 of FDC)
  b3     TS  Two Side (0=yes, 1=no (!))   GM82C765: Also WP (same as bit6)?
  b4     T0  Track 0 (on track 0 we are)
  b5     RY  Ready (drive ready signal)   GM82C765: Always 1=Ready
  b6     WP  Write Protected (write protected)
  b7     FT  Fault (if supported: 1=Drive failure) GM82C765: Always 0=Okay

Notes:
Before accessing a disk you should first Recalibrate the drive, that'll move
the head backwards until it reaches Track 0 (that's required to initialize the
FDCs track counter). On a 80 track drive you may need to repeat that in case
that the first recalibration attempt wasn't successful (that's because the FDC
stops searching after 77 steps) (at least older uPD765 chips did so, maybe the
MCS3201FN/GM82C765B chips don't).

Now if you want to format, read or write a sector on a specific track you must
first Seek that track (command 0Fh). That'll move the read/write head to the
physical track number. If you don't do that, then the FDC will attempt to
read/write data to/from the current physical track, independendly of the
specified logical Track-ID.

The Track-, Sector-, and Head-IDs are logical IDs only. These logical IDs are
defined when formatting the disk, and aren't required to be identical to the
physical Track, Sector, or Head numbers. However, when reading or writing a
sector you must specify the same IDs that have been used during formatting.

Despite of the confusing name, a sector with a "Deleted Data Address Mark"
(DAM) is not deleted. The DAM-flag is just another ID-bit, and (if that ID-bit
is specified correctly in the command) it can be read/written like normal data
sectors.

DMA/IRQ
Most (or all) SNES copiers don't support DMA or IRQs (some are allowing to poll
the IRQ flag by software I/O).

Terminal Count (TC)
*** Below info applies to Amstrad CPC with uPD765 chip.
*** Unknown if anything similar applies to SNES with MCS3201FN/GM82C765B chips.
At the end of a successful read/write command, the program should send a
Terminal Count (TC) signal to the FDC. However, in the CPC the TC pin isn't
connected to the I/O bus, making it impossible for the program to confirm a
correct operation. For that reason, the FDC will assume that the command has
failed, and it'll return both Bit 6 in Status Register 0 and Bit 7 in Status
Register 1 set. The program should ignore this errormessage.

SNES Cart Copiers - Floppy Disc FAT12 Format
--------------------------------------------

The SNES Copier floppy format is compatible to that used under DOS on PCs.
Typical formats are 3.5", Double Density, 80 Tracks/9 Sectors, Double Sided
(720KB). The Sectors are logically numbered 01h..09h, and each sized 200h
bytes.
XXX HD-disks have more sectors
XXX snes copiers are usually HD (or maybe some are DD?)
XXX snes copiers support 1.44MB and 1.6MB (FDFORMAT-like)

Boot-Record
The first sector is always used as bootsector, giving information about the
usage of the following sectors, and including the boot procedure (for loading
MSDOS etc).
  00-02       80x86 boot procedure (jmp opcode) (not used for SNES)
  03-0A       ascii disk name
  0B-0C       bytes / sector
  0D          sectors / cluster
  0E-0F       sectors / boot-record
  10          number of FAT-copys
  11-12       entrys / root-directory
  13-14       sectors / disk
  15          ID: F8=hdd, F9=3.5", FC=SS/9sec, FD=DS9, FE=SS8,FF=DS8
  16-17       sectors / FAT
  18-19       sectors / track
  1A-1B       heads / disk
  1C-1D       number of reserved sectors
  1E-1FF      MSX boot procedure (Z80 code) (not used for SNES)

FAT and FAT copy(s)
The following sectors are occupied by the File Allocation Table (FAT), which
contains 12- or 16-bit entries for each cluster:
  (0)000      unused, free
  (0)001      ???
  (0)002...   pointer to next cluster in chain (0)002..(F)FEF
  (F)FF0-6    reserved (no part of chain, not free)
  (F)FF7      defect cluster, don't use
  (F)FF8-F    last cluster of chain
Number and size of FATs can be calculated by the information in the boot
sector.

Root directory
The following sectors are the Root directory, again, size depends on the info
in bootsector. Each entry consists of 32 bytes:
  00-07       Filename (first byte: 00=free entry,2E=dir, E5=deleted entry)
  08-0A       Filename extension
  0B          Fileattribute
  0C-15       reserved
  16-17       Timestamp: HHHHHMMM, MMMSSSSS
  18-19       Datestamp: YYYYYYYM, MMMDDDDD
  1A-1B       Pointer to first cluster of file
  1C-1F       Filesize in bytes
The 'cluster' entry points to the first used cluster of the file. The FAT entry
for that cluster points to the next used cluster (if any), the FAT entry for
that cluster points to the next cluster, and so on.

Reserved Sectors (if any)
Usually the number of reserved sectors is zero. If it is non-zero, then the
following sector(s) are reserved (and could be used by the boot procedure for
whatever purposes).

Data Clusters 0002..nnnn
Finally all following sectors are data clusters. The first cluster is called
cluster number (0)002, followed by number (0)003, (0)004, and so on.

Special Features
Unknown if any copiers support sub-directories.
Unknown if any copiers support long file names.
Unknown if any copiers support compressed files (ZIP or such).

Super Famicom Box (Japan/Nintendo)
For use in hotels. Typically contains two special multi-carts (which, together,
contain a menu-program and 5 games).

DS-109S (Third-Party/Japan?) (Osaka Tu...?)
For hotels or so. Contains 10 regular SNES/SFC cartridges. Game selection is
done via a push button and single-digit 7-segment LED display. Not much more
known about the hardware.

Nintendo Gateway System / Lodgenet (USA/Third-Party)
For hotels and airports or so. Reportedly offers 18 SNES games or so (later
versions allow games for other/newer consoles). There seem to be no photos of
the hardware. With the "net" in in "Lodgenet" mind... it might be "server
based" (with only Controller & TV-Set located in the hotel room, and the actual
Console & Games located elsewhere?).

  Press Reset Button (on SFC-Box Front Panel) --> Restart Boot Menu

GAME/TV Button
Allows to switch between Game & TV mode. The purpose is totally unclear...
maybe it just allows to disable forwarding the Antenna-input to the TF-Out
connector... but, <why> should one want to disable that?

SFC-Box Cartridges
The SFC-Box contains two special multi-game cartridges. There have been only 4
cartridges produced. The first cartridge MUST be always PSS61 (contains 3
games, plus the required GUI and 128Kbyte SRAM). The second cartridge can be
PSS62, PSS63, or PSS64 (which contain 2 games each; these carts have no own
SRAM, but they can share portions of the SRAM from the PSS61 cart).

SFC-Box Special ROM/EPROMs
  KROM 1     EPROM -not dumped- (Z80 BIOS in SFC-Box console)
  GROM1-1    EPROM 32Kbytes     (Directory) (IC1 in PSS61 cart)
  GROM2-1    EPROM 32Kbytes     (Directory) (IC1 in PSS62 cart)
  GROM3-1    EPROM 32Kbytes     (Directory) (IC1 in PSS63 cart)
  GROM4-1    EPROM -not dumped- (Directory) (IC1 in PSS64 cart)
  ATROM-4S-0 LoROM 512Kbytes    (GUI "Attraction" Menu) (ROM5 in PSS61 cart)
ATROM-4S-0 contains a regular SNES header at 7FC0h, interesting entries are:
  7FC0h Title "4S ATTRACTION        "
  7FD6h Coprocessors (00h) (none, but, ATROM can communicate with the Z80)
  7FD8h RAM Size (00h) (none, but, GROM indicates 32Kbytes allocated to ATROM)
  7FDAh Maker (B6h) (HAL ???, but, as far as known, it's made by Nintendo)
Note: "KROM 1" and "GROM4-1" aren't dumped yet. "GROM3-1" is dumped (but its
ROM-image is "conventionally" misnamed as "GROM1-3"). There is reportedly also
a "different" GUI version (not confirmed/details unknown, maybe there's just a
configuration setting, in EPROMs or so, that changes the GUI appearance).

SFC-Box Game ROMs
  SHVC-4M-1  LoROM 2048Kbytes (Mario Collection) (ROM3 in PSS61 cart)
  SHVC-MK-0  HiROM 512Kbytes  (Mario Kart)       (ROM12 in PSS61 cart)
  SHVC-FO-1  LoROM 1024Kbytes (Starfox)          (IC23 in PSS61 cart)
  SHVC-GC-0  LoROM 1024Kbytes (WaiaraeGolf)      (ROM1 in PSS62 cart)
  SHVC-2A-1  HiROM 512Kbytes  (Mahjong)          (ROM9 in PSS62 cart)
  SHVC-8X-1  HiROM 4096Kbytes (Donkey Kong)      (ROM7 in PSS63 cart)
  SHVC-T2-1  LoROM 1024Kbytes (Tetris2/Bombliss) (ROM3 in PSS63 cart)
  SHVC-8X-?  HiROM 4096Kbytes (Donkey Kong)      (ROM-? in PSS64 cart)
  SHVC-M4-?  HiROM 1024Kbytes (Bomberman2)       (ROM-? in PSS64 cart)
All Game ROMs seem to be identical as in normal (japanese) cartridges, (ie.
without any SFC-Box specific revisions).

SNES Hotel SFC-Box Coprocessor (Z80 or so)
------------------------------------------

This is the "heart" of the SFC-Box - and there is almost nothing known about
it. The two central parts are a CPU (with unknown part number) (maybe a Z80),
and a 64Kbyte EPROM labelled "KROM 1" (probably the main BIOS, with
unknown/undumped content). Plus, a frightening amount of about 50 small logic
chips on the mainboard & daughterboard.

Judging from the "Z80" code in GROM chips, the CPU might be a HD64180 or Z180
or similar CPU (with extended Z80 instruction set)? If so, see:
--> HD64180

Overall Features are (probably)...
  - Injecting Controller Data (for Demo/Preview mode)
  - Sniffing Controller Data (for L+R+Select+Start Soft-Reset feature)
  - Send/Receive Data to the SNES Menu Program (via WRIO/RDIO ports)
  - Mapping the selected Game ROM (or Menu Program) into SNES memory
  - Maybe also mapping GAME-SRAM bank(s) and/or the DSP-1 chip
  - Resetting the SNES, for starting the Game ROM (or Menu Program)
  - Reading "GROM" data from EPROMs in the cartridges
  - Reportedly drawing an extra "OSD" video layer on top of the SNES picture
  - Accessing the RTC Real-Time-Clock (unknown purpose)
  - Somehow logging/counting or restricting the "pay-per-play" time
  - Maybe handling the GAME/TV button in whatever fashion
  - Maybe controlling the two GAME/TV LEDs

Pay-per-play
Not much known there. Some people say the SFC-Box was coin-operated... but, it
doesn't contain any coin-slot, and there seem to be no external connectors for
external coin-slot hardware. And, there seem to be no external connectors for a
"network-cable" for automatically charging the room-bill.

Usage of [4201]=RDIO / [4213]=WRIO on SNES Side (used by Menu Program)
Default WRIO output value is 00E6h.
  bit0 Out (usually Output=LOW, from SNES) (maybe indicate ready)
  bit1 In  (status/ready/malfunction or so, to SNES)
  bit2 In  (data in, to SNES)
  bit3 Out (clock/ack out, from SNES)
  bit4 Out (data out, from SNES)
  bit5 In  (clock in, to SNES)
  bit6 -   (probably normal joy1 io-line)
  bit7 -   (probably normal joy2 io-line & lightgun latch)
After booting, the SNES menu program checks the initial "1bit" status, and does
then repeatedly receive 32bit packets (one command byte, and three parameter
bytes) (and, in reponse to certain commands, it does additionally send or
receive further bytes).

SNES Hotel SFC-Box Real-Time Clock
----------------------------------

Seiko/Epson S-3520CF Serial 4bit Real-Time Clock (RTC)
Contains the usual Time/Date registers, plus 120bit battery-backed RAM (aka 15
bytes) (organized in 2 pages of 15 x 4bits).

The RTC is probably connected to the Z80 in the SFC-Box (details on I/O ports
and purpose of the RTC are unknown).

  Mode   Mode for Register 0-E (0=RTC, 1=Reserved, 2=SramPage0, 3=SramPage1)
If STA=0 then it's safe to read the time (counters won't change within next
3.9ms). If STA=1 then one should wait until STA=0 before reading the time (else
one may miss counter-carry-outs).

Serial Access
Set /CLK and /CS to HIGH as default level. Set /WR to desired direction (before
dragging /CS low). Then set /CS to LOW to invoke transfer. Then issue one (or
more) Index+Data pairs (eight CLK pulses). Then set /CS back HIGH.
Index and Data are both 4bit wide, each transferred LSB first. Bits should be
output (to DataIn) on falling CLK edge, and can be read (from DataOut)
at-or-after raising CLK edge.
In most cases, the written "Index+Data" pairs are actually "Index+Dummy" pairs
(in read-mode, "Data" is obviously ignored) (and when writing to counter
registers, "Data" is also ignored, and instead, the counter is just
incremented) (ie. "Data" is used only when writing to Control/Mode Registers or
SRAM).

SNES Hotel SFC-Box GROM Format
------------------------------

All SFC-Box Cartridges are containing a 32Kbyte "GROM" EPROM, the chip contains
info about the ROMs in the cartridge (title, instructions, etc).

GROM Overall Memory Map
  0000h - Header and Z80 Code
  1000h - ROM 1 Info
  2000h - ROM 2 Info
  3000h - ROM 3 Info (if any)
  4000h - ROM 4 Info (if any)
  5000h - ROM 5 Info (none such)
  6000h - ROM 6 Info (none such)
  7000h - ROM 7 Info (none such, maybe not possible at all)
  7FFCh - Checksum (above bytes at 0000h..7FFBh added together)
  7FFEh - Complement (same as above Checksum, XORed by FFFFh)

GROM - Header (located at 0000h)
  0000h 1   Number of ROMs (usually 02h or 04h) (NumROMs)
  0001h 1   Unknown (05h)
  0002h 1   Unknown (00h or 01h or 09h)
  0003h 1   Unknown (00h)
  0004h 1   Unknown (07h or 00h)
  0005h 1   Unknown (01h or 00h)
  0006h 2   Offset to Z80 code (0020h or 0030h)
  0008h 2   Unknown (0010h) (maybe offset to increasing numbers)
  000Ah 2   Unknown (0000h)
  000Ch 1   Unknown (78h)
  000Dh 1   Unknown (B0h or 00h)
  000Eh 2   Unknown (FFFFh) (maybe unused)
This is followed by "Increasing Numbers" located at 0010h:
  NumROMs words (ranging from 0001h to NumROMs)
  (probably index to ROM info, divided by 1000h?)
followed by:
  NumROMs bytes (ranging from 01h to NumROMs, or from 00h to NumROMs-1)
  (unknown purpose) (00h is used for ATROM menu)
  Maybe physical location on PCB:
  00h ROM5            (upper-right) (AttractionMenu)
  01h ROM1/ROM7/ROM12 (lower-right or upper-left) (MarioKar,Mahjong,Donkey)
  02h ROM3/ROM9       (middle-right) (MarioCol,Waiarae,Tetris)
  03h IC23            (special GSU ROM location) (StarFox)
followed by FFh-filled memory, then followed by the Z80 code at 0020h or 0030h:
Around 256-bytes of Z80 code, apparently called with a flag in A register,
something in E register, and a memory pointer in BC register (which is then
moved to IX register). The function processes incoming values at [ptr+0..7],
and does then write something to [ptr+8..9]. [ptr+4] seems to be the SRAM Size
value from [P0+17h]? For whatever purpose, it also includes two non-Z80
opcodes: ED-39-C0 and ED-39-C1 (on a normal Z80, ED-39 would act as "NOP", C0
and C1 would act as "RET NZ" and "POP BC").

  2Bh 22 Unknown (all 2Eh-filled)      ;<-- located at index 2Ah in Star Fox
Bitmap-Title-Tiles (at P1):

  2 bytes - Number of following bytes (N) (varies 02D5h..0573h)
  N bytes - Compressed Title Bitmap (128x24 pix, 4bpp) (16x3 Tiles)
  (the uncompressed bitmap consists of 3 rows of 16 bit-planed 4bpp SNES tiles)
  (see below for the compression format)
Bitmap-Padding-Tile (at P2):
  32 bytes - Uncompressed Padding Tile (8x8 pix, 4bpp)
  (used to pad the 128x24 pix title bitmap, centered within a 160x24 pix area)
  (should be usually uni-colored tile, with same color as bitmap's background)
  (or, alternately, one could probably also use a "hatched" background pattern)
Bitmap-Palette (at P3):
  32 bytes - 16-color Palette for Title Bitmap (words in range 0000h..7FFFh)
  (color 0 is unused/transparent, usually contains 0038h as dummy value)
Shift-JIS Instruction Pages (at P4):
  1 byte - Number of Pages
  N bytes - Page(s)
  Each page starts with a 6-byte header (usually 8,2,4,1,4,4), followed
  by Text (mixed 7bit ASCII, 8bit JIS, and 2x8bit Shift-JIS), lines are
  terminated by chr(09h), each page terminated by chr(00h).
Whatever (at P5):   ;<-- if none: eight 00h-bytes
Whatever (at P6):   ;<-- if none: four 00h-bytes
  1 byte - Unknown (usually 05h)
  2 byte - Number of following 4-Byte Pairs (N)
  N*4 bytes - data (most 4-byte pairs are "xx,FF,FF,FF")
  (might be whatever charset and/or bitplanes)
  (or rather controller-data for demo/preview, in format: Time,Lsb,Msb,FFh)

Unknown parts
The GROM should/must contain info where which ROM is on the PCB...?
The GROM might contain info about SRAM-base (unless it's automatic)?
The GROM might contain OSD screen coordinates or so?
Are P5 and P6 fields controller data? And why are there two fields? 2 players?
Maybe the P0-field contains extra flags which P2..P6 fields do exist?
According to photos, the GUI/menu orders the ROMs differently as in GROM1-1?

IC16 is 128K SRAM, this chip is installed in the PSS61 cartridge only, but,
it's shared for multiple games (including games in PSS62-PSS64 carts).
The SRAM isn't battery-backed, however, the SFC-Box cannot be switched off
(without a key), so SRAM should be always receiving a standby-voltage from the
console.
The hardware might allow to share the DSP1 chip in similar fashion (?), in the
existing carts, it's used only for Mario Kart.
The "optional" components are installed in PSS61 only. The "semi-optional" ones
are installed in PSS61 and (for unknown reason) in PSS62 (whilst, PSS63 doesn't
have them, although it should be functionally same as PSS62). Unknown which
components are in PSS64.

Unknown how many different programs are possible (there are pads for max 6 DIP
ROMs, plus 1 SMD ROM, but maybe the SMD is alternate to one DIP, and maybe some
pads are reserved for games with 2 ROMs; and unknown if the GUI menu supports
more than 5 games).

On a real Z80, ED-4C/5C/6C/7C and ED-64/74 have been mirrors of NEG.
On a real Z80, ED-70 did the same (but was undocumented).
On a real Z80, ED-76 has been mirror of IM 2.
On a real Z80, ED-00..3F and ED-80..9F have acted as NOP.

Notes
IN0/OUT0/OTxMx same as IN/OUT/OTxx but with I/O-address bit8-15 forced 00h.
TST op: Test A,op.  ;non-destructive AND (only flags changed)
TSTIO nn: Test Port[C],nn  ;\hitachi lists BOTH definitions (page 75)
TSTIO nn: Test Port[nn],A  ;/zilog also lists BOTH definitions (page 173,174)
MLT xy: xy=x*y   ;unsigned multiply (flags=unchanged)
SLP (SLEEP) stops internal clock (including stopping DRAM refresh and DMAC.
IOSTOP: stops ASCI, CSI/O, PRT.

Z80 incompatible opcodes (according to Zilog's Z180 Application Note)
  Opcode    Z80                     Z180
  DAA       Checks Cy and A>99h     Checks Cy only? (when N=1)
  RLD/RRD   Sets flags for A        Sets flags for [HL]

Opcode Execution Time
Some opcodes are slightly faster as on real Z80. For example, some (not all)
4-cycle Z80 opcodes take only 3-cyles on HD64180.

Undefined Opcodes
On the HD64180, undefined opcodes are causing a TRAP exception (this feature
cannot be disabled). So, while the real Z80 does have some useful (and some
useless) undocumented opcodes, none (?) of these is working on HD64180 (except
for the now-official ED-70 opcode).
The HD64180 datasheet doesn't list "SLL" as valid opcode.
The HD64180 datasheet doesn't list the "SET-and-LD" or "RES-and-LD" opcodes.
The HD64180 datasheet doesn't list opcodes with "IXL,IXH,IYL,IYH" operands,
however, it does mention existence of "IXL" here and there (however, that seems
to refer only to 16bit operations like "PUSH IX" (which do internally split
16bit IX into two 8bit units).
The HD64180 datasheet lists EX DE,HL with IX/IY-prefix as invalid.

07h - TDR0 - ASCI Channel 1 Transmit Data Register
08h - RDR0 - ASCI Channel 0 Receive Data Register
09h - RDR0 - ASCI Channel 1 Receive Data Register
  7-0  Data
The hardware can hold one byte in the data register (plus one byte currently
processed in a separate shift register).

0Ah - CNTR - CSI/O Control Register (0Fh on Reset)
  7   EF    End Flag, completion of Receive/Transmit (0=No/Busy, 1=Yes/Ready)
  6   EIE   End Interrupt Enable (0=Disable, 1=Enable)

  3   -     Unused (should be all-ones)
  2-0 SS    Speed Select (0..6: "(20 shl N) clks per bit", 7=External clock)
The select "speed" is output on CKS pin (or input from CKS pin when selecting
External clock). Bit7 is read-only (cleared when reading/writing TRDR).

0Bh - TRDR - CSI/O Transmit/Receive Data Register
  7-0  Data (called TRDR by Hitachi, called TRD by Zilog)
Data is output on TXS pin, and input on RXS pin. Despite of the separate pins,
one may NOT set RE and TE simultanoulsy (for whatever reason). The RXS pin is
also used as /CTS1 (for ASCI channel 1).

ASCI Multi Processor "Network" Feature
This feature allows to share the serial bus by multiple computers. Each byte is
transferred with a "MPB" Multi Processor Flag Bit (located between Data and
Stop bits) (Parity is forcefully disabled in Multi Processor Mode).
Assume broadcasting "Header+Data" Packets (with "Header" bytes flagged as
MPB=1, and "Data" as MPB=0): The RX-Filter can select to receive only "Header"
bytes, and, if the receiver treats itself to be addressed by the header, it can
change the filter setting depending on whether it wants to receive/skip the
following "Data" bytes.

HD64180 Timers (PRT and FRC)
----------------------------

Programmable Reload Timers (PRT) and Free Running Counter (FRC)

10h - TCR - Timer Control Register (00h on Reset)
  7   TIF1  Timer 1 Interrupt Flag (0=No, 1=Yes/Decrement reached 0000h) (R)
  6   TIF0  Timer 0 Interrupt Flag (0=No, 1=Yes/Decrement reached 0000h) (R)
  5   TIE1  Timer 1 Interrupt Emable (0=Disable, 1=Enable)
  4   TIE0  Timer 0 Interrupt Emable (0=Disable, 1=Enable)
  3-2 TOC   Timer 1 Output Control to A18-Pin (0=A18, 1=Toggled, 2=Low, 3=High)
  1   TDIE1 Timer 1 Decrement Enable (0=Stop, 1=Decrement; once every 20 clks)
  0   TDIE0 Timer 0 Decrement Enable (0=Stop, 1=Decrement; once every 20 clks)
TIF1 is reset when reading TCR or TMDR1L or TMDR1H.
TIF0 is reset when reading TCR or TMDR0L or TMDR0H.
The TOC bits control the A18/TOUT pin (it can be either A18 address line, or
forced to Low or High, or "toggled": that is, inverted when TMDR1 decremts to
0.

0Ch - TMDR0L - Timer 0 Counter "Data" Register, Bit0-7 (FFh on Reset)
0Dh - TMDR0H - Timer 0 Counter "Data" Register, Bit8-15 (FFh on Reset)
0Eh - RLDR0L - Timer 0 Reload Register, Bit0-7 (FFh on Reset)
0Fh - RLDR0H - Timer 0 Reload Register, Bit8-15 (FFh on Reset)
Timer 0 counter/reload values. The counter is decremented once every 20 clks,
and triggers IRQ and gets reloaded when reaching 0000h. Reading TMDR0L returns
current timer LSB, and latches current timer MSB. Reading TMDR0H returns that
LATCHED timer MSB. Accordingly reads should be always done in order LSB, MSB.
If the timer is stopped TMDR0L/TMDR0H can be written (and read) in any order.

14h - TMDR1L - Timer 1 Counter "Data" Register, Bit0-7 (FFh on Reset)
15h - TMDR1H - Timer 1 Counter "Data" Register, Bit8-15 (FFh on Reset)
16h - RLDR1L - Timer 1 Reload Register, Bit0-7 (FFh on Reset)
17h - RLDR1H - Timer 1 Reload Register, Bit8-15 (FFh on Reset)
Timer 1 counter/reload values. Same as for Timer 0 (see above).

18h - FRC - Free Running Counter (FFh on Reset)
  7-0 FRC   Free Running Counter (decremented every 10 clks)
This register should be read-only, writing to FRC may mess up DRAM refresh,
ASCI and CSI/O baud rates.

HD64180 Direct Memory Access (DMA)
----------------------------------

20h - SAR0L - DMA Channel 0 Source Address, Bit0-7 (Memory or I/O)
21h - SAR0H - DMA Channel 0 Source Address, Bit8-15 (Memory or I/O)
22h - SAR0B - DMA Channel 0 Source Address, Bit16-19 (Memory or DRQ)
23h - DAR0L - DMA Channel 0 Destination Address, Bit0-7 (Memory or I/O)
24h - DAR0H - DMA Channel 0 Destination Address, Bit8-15 (Memory or I/O)
25h - DAR0B - DMA Channel 0 Destination Address, Bit16-19 (Memory or DRQ)
26h - BCR0L - DMA Channel 0 Byte Count Register, Bit0-7
27h - BCR0H - DMA Channel 0 Byte Count Register, Bit8-15
DMA Channel 1 Source/Dest/Len. Direction can be Memory-to-Memory,
Memory-to-I/O, I/O-to-Memory, or I/O-to-I/O, Memory-Address can be Fixed,
Incrementing, or Decrementing, I/O-Address is Fixed (see DMODE Register).
For I/O transfers, Bit16-17 of SAR/DAR are selecting the DRQ type:
  00h DRQ by /DREQ0-Pin (normal case)
  01h DRQ by ASCI Channel 0 (RDRF-Bit for Source, or TDRE-Bit for Dest)
  02h DRQ by ASCI Channel 1 (RDRF-Bit for Source, or TDRE-Bit for Dest)
  03h Reserved
Memory-to-Memory DMA clock can be selected in MMOD bit ("Burst" pauses CPU
until transfer is completed, "Cycle Steal" keeps the CPU running at roughly
half-speed during DMA).

28h - MAR1L - DMA Channel 1 Memory Address, Bit0-7 (Source or Dest)
29h - MAR1H - DMA Channel 1 Memory Address, Bit8-15 (Source or Dest)

On some chip versions address bus is only 19bits, namely that does apply on

the extra bit might (maybe) exist internally on newer 64pin chips(?)

Note: "I" is a CPU-register (set via MOV I,A opcode). "IL" is new I/O port (set
via OUT opcode). /INT0 works same as on real Z80 (and depends on mode set via
IM 0/1/2 opcodes).

TRAP gets set upon Undefined Opcodes (TRAP and RESET are both using vector
0000h, the TRAP bit allows to sense if the vector was called by Reset or Undef
Opcode). The TRAP bit can be cleared by software by writing "0" to it (however,
software cannot write "1" to it).

HD64180 Memory Mapping and Control
----------------------------------

Memory Managment Unit (MMU)
The Memory Managment Unit translates "virtual" 16bit CPU memory addresses to
"physical" 19bit address bus.
  0000h -------> +--------------------+
                 | Common Area 0      | Phys19bit = Virt16bit + 00000h
  BA*1000h ----> +--------------------+
                 | Bank Area          | Phys19bit = Virt16bit + BBR*1000h
  CA*1000h ----> +--------------------+
                 | Common Area 1      | Phys19bit = Virt16bit + CBR*1000h
  FFFFh -------> +--------------------+
The 16bit CPU address space is divided into three areas (of which, the first
two areas can be 0 bytes in size: BA=0 disables Common Area 0, CA=CB disables
Bank Area).

38h - CBR - MMU Common Base Register (Common Area 1) (00h on Reset)
39h - BBR - MMU Bank Base Register (Bank Area) (00h on Reset)
  7   Unused (should be zero) (but, used on chips with 20bit address bus)
  0-6 Base in 4K-units within "physical" 19bit 512K address space

3Ah - CBAR - MMU Common/Bank Area Register (F0h on Reset)
  4-7 CA Start of Common Area 1 (End of Bank Area) (0Fh upon Reset)
  0-3 BA Start of Bank Area (End of Common Area 0) (00h upon Reset)
This is in 4K-units within the "virtual" 16bit 64K address space. Results on
CA<CB are undefined.

36h - RCR - Refresh Control Register (FCh on Reset)
  7   REFE  DRAM Refresh Enable (0=Disable, 1=Enable)
  6   REFW  DRAM Refresh Wait (0=Two Clocks, 1=Three Clks)
  5-2 -     Unused (should be all-ones)
  1-0 CYC   DRAM Refresh Interval (0..3=10,20,40,80 states)
Note: The hardware outputs an 8bit Refresh address on A0..A7. A classic Z80 did
output only 7bits, via using the CPU's "R" register (accessible with MOV A,R
and MOV R,A opcodes). The HD64180 does still increment lower 7bit of "R" in
same/similar fashion as on Z80, but, as far as I understand, without affecting
any bits of the actual refresh address (and vice-versa, without the
RCR-register settings affecting the way how "R" gets incremented).

3Fh - ICR - I/O Control Register (1Fh on Reset)
  7-6 IOA   Base Address of Internal I/O ports (0..3=0000h,0040h,0080h,00C0h)
  5   IOSTP Stop Internal ASCI, CSI/O, PRT-Timers (0=No, 1=Pause)
  4-0 -     Unused (all ones on Reset)
Note: There is a "z180.h" file in the internet that claims that ICR "does not
move" (ie. that the "IOA" bits affect only Port 00h-3Eh, but not Port 3Fh
itself). Unknow where that info comes from, and unknown if it's correct (the
HD64180 and Z180 datasheets do not mention that effect).

Memory Address Bus Width
According to official specs, the address bus is 19bits wide (although the same
specs claim that it can address up to 1Mbyte, which would require 20bits,
unknown how that could work). [The 68pin and 80pin chip versions do actually
have a new A19 pin, which doesn't exist on 64pin chips]
Observe that A18 can be misused as Square-Wave output or as General-purpose
output (see Timer chapter); when using that feature, one should normally
connect only A0..A17 to memory address bus - otherwise, if A18 is wired to
memory, the feature would cause the physical address to be ANDed with 3FFFFh or
ORed with 40000h (this "allows" to some futher, but rather useless,
bankswitching).

Waitstate Control
For Memory and I/O Waitstate control, see DCNTL register (in DMA chapter).

DMA
DMA transfers can directly access 19bit addresses, without using the MMU.

Unused Bits
Several internal registers contain unused bits. According to the datasheet,
upon reset, these bits are set to all-ones, or all-zero (the setting varies
from register to register). Unknown if it's possible and/or allowed to change
these bits.

Reserved Registers
Registers 11h-13h, 19h-1Fh, 2Dh, 35h, 37h, 3Bh-3Eh are Reserved. Unknown if
it's possible and/or allowed to read/write these registers.

SNES Decompression Formats
--------------------------

Nintendo-specific Compression Overall Format (BSX and SFC-Box)
Compressed data consists of "code/length" pairs encoded in 1 or 2 bytes:
  cccNnnnn           --> code (ccc=0..6) len 5bit (Nnnnn+1)
  111cccNn.nnnnnnnn  --> code (ccc=0..7) len 10bit (Nnnnnnnnnn+1)
  11111111           --> end code (FFh)
The "code/length" pairs are then follwed by "src" data, or "disp" offsets
(depending on the "ccc" codes). The meaning of the "ccc" codes varies from
program to program (see below for how they are used by BSX and SFC-Box).
Note: As seen above, ccc=7 works only with 10bit len (not 5bit len) and only
with max len=2FFh+1 (not 3FFh+1).

Nintendo-specific Compression Codes (BSX) (Satellaview)
Used to decompress various data (including custom person OBJs in the Directory
packet). The decompression functions are at 80939Fh (to RAM) and 80951Eh (to
VRAM) in the BSX-BIOS. The meaning of the "ccc" codes is:
  0  Copy_bytes_from_src
  1  Fill_byte_from_src
  2  Fill_word_from_src
  3  Fill_incrementing_byte_from_src
  4  Copy_bytes_from_dest_base_plus_16bit_disp
  5  Copy_bytes_from_dest_base_plus_16bit_disp_with_invert
  6  Copy_bytes_from_current_dest_addr_minus_8bit_disp
  7  Copy_bytes_from_current_dest_addr_minus_8bit_disp_with_invert
For all codes (including ccc=2), len is the number of BYTEs to be
copied/filled. For ccc=4..6, the code is followed by a 16bit offset in
LITTLE-ENDIAN format. For ccc=5/7, copied data is inverted (XORed with FFh).

Nintendo-specific Compression Codes (SFC-Box) (Super Famicom Box)
Used (among others) to decompress the Title-Bitmaps in "GROM" EPROMs, the
decompression function is at 0088A2h in the "ATROM" menu program. The meaning
of the "ccc" codes is:
  0  Copy_bytes_from_src
  1  Fill_byte_from_src
  2  Fill_word_from_src
  3  Fill_incrementing_byte_from_src
  4  Copy_bytes_from_dest_base_plus_16bit_disp
  5  Copy_bytes_from_dest_base_plus_16bit_disp_with_xflip
  6  Copy_bytes_from_dest_base_plus_16bit_disp_with_yflip
  7  Unused (same as ccc=4)
For ccc=2, len is the number of WORDs to be filled, for all other codes, it's
the number of BYTEs to be copied/filled. For ccc=4..7, the code is followed by
a 16bit offset in BIG-ENDIAN format. For ccc=5 (xflip), bit-order of all bytes
is reversed (bit0/1/2/3 <--> bit7/6/5/4). For ccc=6 (yflip), reading starts at
dest_base+disp (as usually), but the read-address is then decremented after
each byte-transfer (instead of incremented).

SNES Decompression Hardware
The APU automatically decompresses BRR-encoded audio samples (4bit to 15bit
ADPCM, roughly similar to CD-XA format). Cartridges with SPC7110 or S-DD1 chips
can decompress (roughly JPEG-style) video data, and convert it to SNES
bit-plane format. Cartridges with SA-1 chips include a "Variable-Length Bit
Processing" feature for reading "N" bits from a compressed bit-stream.

SNES Unpredictable Things
-------------------------

Open Bus
Garbage appears on reads from unused addresses (see below), on reads from
registers that contain less than 8 bits (see more below), and on reads from
(most) write-only registers (see even more below). The received data is the
value being previously output on the data bus. In most cases, that is the last
byte of the opcode (direct reads), or the upper byte of indirect address
(indirect reads), ie.
  LDA IIJJ,Y   aka MOV A,[IIJJ+Y]  --> garbage = II
  LDA (NN),Y   aka MOV A,[[NN]+Y]  --> garbage = [NN+1]
When using General Purpose DMA, it'd be probably rely on the store opcode that
has started the DMA (in similar fashion as above loads). In case of HDMA things
would be most unpredictable, garbage would be whatever current-opcode related
value. And, if two DMA transfers follow directly after each other, garbage
would probably come from the previous DMA.
Also, in 6502-mode (and maybe also in 65816-mode), the CPU may insert
dummy-fetches from unintended addresses on page-wraps?

Unused Addresses in the System Region
  Address       Size
  2000h..20FFh  100h    ;unused addresses
  2181h..2183h  3       ;write-only WRAM Address registers
  2184h..21FFh  7Ch     ;unused addresses in the B-BUS region
  2200h..3FFFh  1E00h   ;unused addresses
  4000h..4015h  16h     ;unused slow-CPU Ports
  4018h..41FFh  1E8h    ;unused slow-CPU Ports
  4200h..420Dh  0Eh     ;write-only CPU Ports
  420Eh..420Fh  2       ;unused CPU Ports
  4220h..42FFh  E0h     ;unused CPU Ports
  43xCh..43xEh  3*8     ;unused DMA Ports
  4380h..7FFFh  3C80h   ;unused/expansion area
So, of the total of 8000h bytes, a large number of 5EF4h is left unused.
Ports 2144h..217Fh are APU mirrors, NOT open bus.

Unused bits (in Ports with less than 8 used bits)
  Addr  Mask Name    Unused Bits
  4016h FCh  JOYA    Bit7-2 are open bus
  4017h E0h  JOYB    Bit7-5 are open bus
  4210h 70h  RDNMI   Bit6-4 are open bus
  4211h 7Fh  TIMEUP  Bit6-0 are open bus
  4212h 3Eh  HVBJOY  Bit5-1 are open bus

PPU1 Open Bus
PPU1 Open Bus is relies on the value most recently read from Ports 2134h-2136h,
2138h-213Ah, 213Eh. This memorized value shows up on later reads from read-only
Ports 21x4h..21x6h and 21x8h..21xAh (with x=0,1,2) (in all 8bits), as well as
in Port 213Eh.Bit4.

PPU2 Open Bus
PPU2 Open Bus is relies on the value most recently read from Ports 213Bh-213Dh,
213Fh. This memorized value shows up on later reads from Port
213Bh.2nd_read.Bit7, 213Ch/213Dh.2nd_read.Bits7-1, and Port 213Fh.Bit5.

PPU Normal Open Bus
Other write-only PPU registers & the HV-latch "strobe" register are acting like
"normal" CPU Open Bus (ie. usually returning the most recent opcode byte).
These are 21x0h..21x3h, 21x7h (with x=0,1,2,3), and 21xBh..21xFh (with
x=0,1,2).

Open Bus for DMA
DMA cannot read from most I/O ports, giving it some additional open bus areas:
  2100h-21FFh  Open Bus (when used as A-Bus) (of course they work as B-Bus)
  4000h-41FFh  Open Bus (name 4016h/4017h cannot be read)
          actually, 4017h <does> return bit4-2 set (1=GNDed joypad input)
  4210h-421Fh  These do work (the only I/O ports that are not open bus)
  4300h-437Fh  Special Open Bus (DMA registers, may return [PC] instead of FFh)
For DMA reads, one may expect the same garbage as for CPU reads (ie. when
starting a DMA via "MOV [420Bh],A", one would expect 42h as open bus value).
However, it takes a few cycles before the DMA transfer does actually start,
during that time the hardware "forgets" the 42h value, and instread, DMA does
always read FFh (High-Z) as open bus value. With two exceptions: If DMA wraps
from an used to unused address (eg. from 1FFFh/WRAM to 2000h/unused) then the
first "unused" byte will be same as the last "used" byte, thereafter, it
forgets that value (and returns FFh on further unused addresses).
The other exception is if DMA <starts> at 4300h..437Fh: In this case it will
read [PC] for that region (and will also "memorize" it when reaching the first
unused address at 4380h, and then returns FFh for 4381h and up). For example:
"MOV [420Bh],A" followed by "ADC A,33h" would return 69h (the first byte of the
ADC opcode). This effect occurs only if the transfer <starts> in that region,
ie. if starts below that area, and does then wrap from 42FFh to 4300h, then it
returns FFh instead of 69h. (The reason of this special effect is probably that
the DMA somehow "ignores the databus", so external HIGH-Z levels (like from
XBOO cable or Cartridge) cannot drag the "memorized" value to HIGH.)
EDIT: The above "memorize for next ONE unused address" applies only when XBOO
cable is connected (which pulls the databus to HIGH rather quickly). Without
XBOO cable (and without cartridge connected) the "memorized" value may last for
the next 2000h (!) unused addresses, then it may slowly get corrupted (some
bits going to HIGH state, until, after some more time, all bits are HIGH).
Actually, it seems to last even longer than 2000h -- possibly forever (until
DMA ends, or until it reaches a used address).

SPC700 Division Overflow/Result (DIV YA,X opcode)
The overall division mechanism (with and without overflows) is:
  H = (X AND 0Fh)<=(Y AND 0Fh)   ;half carry flag (odd dirt effect)
  Temp = YA
  FOR i=1 TO 9
    Temp=Temp*2                                     ;\rotate within 17bits
    IF Temp AND 20000h THEN Temp=(Temp XOR 20001h)  ;/
    IF Temp>=(X*200h)  THEN Temp=(Temp XOR 1)
    IF Temp AND 1      THEN Temp=(Temp-(X*200h)) AND 1FFFFh
  NEXT i
  A = (Temp AND FFh) ;result.bit7-0
  V = (Temp.Bit8=1)  ;result.bit8
  Y = (Temp/200h)    ;remainder (aka temp.bit9-16)
  N = (A.Bit7=1)     ;sign-flag (on result.bit7) (though division is unsigned)
  Z = (A=00h)        ;zero-flag (on result.bit7-0)
That is, normally (when result = 0000h..00FFh):
  A=YA/X, Y=YA MOD X, N=ResultingA.Bit7, Z=(ResultingA=00h), V=0, H=(see above)
An intact 9bit result can be read from V:A (when result = 0000h..01FFh).
Otherwise return values are useless garbage (when result = 0200h..Infinite).

CPU Clock Notes
CPU Clock cycles (opcode fetches, data transfers, and internal cycles) are
usually clocked at 3.5MHz or 2.6MHz (or a mixup thereof).
  3.5MHz   Used for Fast ROM, most I/O ports, and internal CPU cycles
  2.6MHz   Used for Slow ROM, for WRAM, and for DMA/HDMA transfers
  1.7MHz   Used only for (some) Joypad I/O Ports
The CPU is paused for 40 master cycles (per 1364 cycle scanline) for memory
REFRESH purposes, effectively making the CPU around 3% slower. The CPU is also
paused when using DMA/HDMA transfers.
Nintendo specifies the following ROM timings to be required:
  3.5MHz   use 120ns or faster ROM/EPROMs
  2.6MHz   use 200ns or faster ROM/EPROMs

Dot Clock Notes
The above values apply for the drawing period, in the hblank period some cycles
are a bit longer. This "stuttering" effect appears also on the dotclk output on
expansion port.

SNES Timing H/V Counters
------------------------

Horizontal Timings
  Scanline Length        1364 master cycles (341 dot cycles)
    Except, Line F0h in Field.Bit=1 of Interlace: 1360 master cycles
  Refresh (per scanline)   40 master cycles (10 dot cycles)

  50*312*1364 = 21.278400 MHz   // 21.281370MHz/(312*1364) = 50.00697891 Hz
  60*262*1364 = 21.442080 MHz   // 21.477270MHz/(262*1364-2) = 60.09880627 Hz

Long and Short Scanlines
A normal scanline is 1364 master cycles long. But, there are two special cases,
in which lines are 4 cycles longer or shorter:
  Short Line --> at 60Hz frame rate + interlace=off + field=1 + line=240
  Long Line  --> at 50Hz frame rate + interlace=on + field=1 + line=311
  (in both cases, the selected picture size, 224 or 239 lines, doesn't matter)
Technically, the effects work as so:
  Normal Line : 1364 cycles, 340 dots (0-339), four dots are 5-cycles long
  Long Line   : 1368 cycles, 341 dots (0-340), four dots are 5-cycles long
  Short Line  : 1360 cycles, 340 dots (0-339), all dots are 4-cycles long
Glitch: The long scanline is placed in the last line (directly after the Hsync
for line 0, thus shifting the Hsync position of Line 1, ie. of the first line
of the drawing period), accordingly, the upper some scanlines in interlaced
50Hz mode are visibly shifted to the right (by around one pixel), until after a
handful of scanlines the picture stablizes on the new hsync position (ie.
trying to display a vertical line will appear a little curved).

Long and Short Scanlines (Purpose)
The Scanline Rate doesn't match up with the PAL/NTSC Color Clocks, so, for
example, a red rectangle on black background will look like so:
  RGB-Output             Composite-Output        Composite-Output
  Flawless               Static-Error            Flimmering-Error
  RRRRRRRRRRRRRRRR       RRRRRRRRRRRRRRRR        rRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRr
  RRRRRRRRRRRRRRRR        RRRRRRRRRRRRRRRR       rrRRRRRRRRRRRRRRrr
  RRRRRRRRRRRRRRRR         RRRRRRRRRRRRRRRR       rRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRr
  RRRRRRRRRRRRRRRR       RRRRRRRRRRRRRRRR        rRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRr
  RRRRRRRRRRRRRRRR        RRRRRRRRRRRRRRRR       rrRRRRRRRRRRRRRRrr
  RRRRRRRRRRRRRRRR         RRRRRRRRRRRRRRRR       rRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRr
Inserting the long/short scanlines does synchronize the Frame Rate with the
PAL/NTSC color clocks:
  PAL Mode        Master Clocks (21MHz)       Color Clocks (PAL:4.4MHz)
  50Hz Normal     425568 (312*1364)           88660 (425568/6*5/4)
  50Hz Interlace  426936 (313*1364+4)         88945 (426936/6*5/4)
  NTSC Mode       Master Clocks (21MHz)       Color Clocks (NTSC:3.5MHz)
  30Hz Normal     714732 ((262+262)*1364-4)   119122 (714732/6)
  30Hz Interlace  716100 ((262+263)*1364)     119350 (716100/6)
The result is that the composite video output is producing the "Static Error"
effect (in the above example, the rectangle has sawtooth-edges). And the
"Flimmering" effect is avoided (which would have blurry edges, and which would
also appear as if the edges were wandering up) (Note: The flimmering effect can
be seen when switching a modded 50Hz PAL console to 60Hz mode).

Note that a PAL TV-set can display around 264 lines (about 25 more than
supported by the 239-line mode).

Note that a superscope pointing at pixel (X, Y) on the screen will latch
approximately dot X+40 on scanline Y+1.

PPU H-Counter-Latch Quantities
When latching PPU H/V-latches via reading [2137h] by software, 341*4 times at
evenly spread locations, one will statistically get following H values:
  0..132    4 times (normal)
  133       3 times (occurs sometimes at H=133.5, and always at H=133.0)
  134       1 time  (occurs sometimes at H=134.x)
  135..142  never   (refresh is busy, cpu is stopped)
  143       1 time  (occurs sometimes at H=143.x)
  144       3 times (occurs sometimes at H=144.0, and always at H=144.5)
  145..322  4 times (normal)
  323       6 times (seen as long dot) (or 5.99 times if NTSC+InterlaceOff)
  324..326  4 times (normal)
  327       6 times (seen as long dot) (or 5.99 times if NTSC+InterlaceOff)
  328..339  4 times (normal)
  340       never   (doesn't exist) (or 0.01 times if PAL+InterlaceOn)
  341-511   never   (doesn't exist)
For the 1 and 3 times effect, one would expect the 40 clk refresh as so:
  --- H=133.5--><--H=134.0 ------------------ H=143.5--><--H=144.0 ---
  ccccccccccccccRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRcccccccccccccc
but, sometimes (randomly at 50:50 chance) it occurs somewhat like so:
  ccccccccccccRRccRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRccRRccccccccccc
whereas "c"=CPU, "R"=Refresh (ie. sometimes, the CPU wakes up within the
Refresh period). Unknown why & when exactly that stuttering refresh occurs.
Opcodes may begin before Refresh, and end after Refresh (rather than forcefully
finishing the Opcode before starting Refresh), so above statistics are same for
latching via "MOV A,[2137h]" (4 cycles) and "MOV A,[002137h]" (5 cycles)
opcodes.
Writing [4201h] (instead of reading [3137h]) shifts the visible refresh-related
H values (H=136..143=never, H=135/144 once, H=134/H=145 thrice), but obviously
doesn't alter the amounts of visible PPU-related H values.

SNES Timing PPU Memory Accesses
-------------------------------

Below is some info/guesses on what is happening during the 1364 master cycles
of a scanline. Plus some info/guesses on if/when/why it is (or isn't) possible
the change VRAM/CGRAM/OAM outside of V-Blank or Forced-Blank.

PPU VRAM Load
VRAM access time is 4 master cycles per word (aka 1 dot-cycle per word). In
each line, the PPU fetches 34*2 words (for 34 OBJ tiles of 8pix/4bpp), plus
33*8 words (for BgMap+BgTiles) (eg. 33*4 BgMap entries plus 33*4 BgTiles at
2bpp in BG Mode 0) (or less BG layers, but more bpp per tile in other BG
Modes).
As a whole, 4 master cycles per 34*2 + 33*8 words sums up to 1328 master cycles
(or possibly a bit more if accesses during "long dots" should happen to take 5
master cycles per word). 1328 would leave 36 unused master cycles per scanline
(or maybe MORE unused cycles if some BG layers are disabled? and/or if less
than 34 OBJ tiles are located in the scanline? unknown if VRAM can be accessed
during any such unused cycles? as far as known, existing games aren't trying to
do so).

PPU Palette Load
Not much known about CGRAM access timings. There would be some theories:
  1) Maybe 512 accesses/line (for frontmost main/sub-screen pixels)
  2) Maybe 1296 accesses/line (for 256*4 BG pixels + 34*8 OBJ pixels)
  3) Maybe 1360 accesses/line (for 33*4*8 BG pixels + 34*8 OBJ pixels)
For the 1296/1360 accesses therories, CGRAM would be inaccessible for most of
the 1364 cycles.
In practice, it is possible to change CGRAM during certain timespots in the
Hblank-period (not during the <whole> Hblank period, but it works <sometimes>,
though doing so may require some research - and may end up with more or less
fragile timings). As for when/why it is working: Maybe there some totally
unused cycles, or it depends on how many OBJs are displayed in the current
scanline, possibly also on the number of used and/or enabled BG layers (and
thereby, maybe also allowing to change CGRAM outside of Hblank during
BG-drawing period?).

PPU OAM load
OAM handling is done in three steps:
 1) scan 128 entries (collect max 32 entries per line)
 2) scan 32 entries (collect max 34 tiles per line)
 3) scan 34 entries (collect max 34x8 pixels per line)
OAM-Access time for Step 1 is 128*2 dots aka 128*8 master cycles (as seen in
STAT77.Bit6). OAM-Access times for Steps 2 and 3 is unknown (might be some
cycles per entry... or might be NULL cycles; in case OAM entries were copied to
separate buffer during previous Step... and/or NULL cycles if no OBJs are in
current scanline).
So, aside from the 256 known/used dot-cycles, there may (or may not) be up to
84 unused dot-cycles... possibly allowing to change OAM during Hblank(?).
Note: Mario Kart is using Forced Blank to change OAM in middle of screen.
Observe that the OAM address in Port 2102h is scattered during drawing period.

Internal Connector
The two joypad connectors (and power LED) are located on a small daughterboard,
which connects to the mainboard via an 11pin connector:
  1 VCC
  2 IO6       ;-pad1
  3 IO7 / pen ;\

  9 CK2 (one short LOW pulse per JOY2/JOY4 data bit)
  10 STB (one short HIGH pulse at begin of transfer)
  11 GND
The daughterboard contains diodes in the CK1, CK2, STB lines, effectively
making them open-collector outputs (so the joypad may require pull-up resistors
for that signals).

In cost-down SNES models, pin 1-4 and 7-8 are reportedly not connected (though
one can upgrade them with some small modifications on the mainboard).

SNES Power Supply
-----------------

AC 9V (PAL version)
Power Supply input. The 9V AC input is internally converted to 9V DC, and is
then converted to 5V DC by a 7805 IC which turns the additional volts into
heat. The CPU/PPU/APU are solely operated at 5V DC (ie. you can feed 5V to the
7805 output). However, 9V DC are used by the Audio Amplifier, the console works
without the 9V supply, but you won't hear any sounds.
The Amplifier does work more less okay with 5V supply (ie. you can shortcut the
7805 input and output pins, and feed 5V to both of them) (when doing that
disconnect the original 9V input to make sure that 9V aren't accidently passed
to the CPU/PPU). However, at 5V, the middle amplitude levels are generated
linearily intact, but the MIN/MAX levels are chopped off, for example a
sawtooth wave looks like so:
  Amplifier Output at 9V:                 Amplifier Output at 5V:
     /|   /|   /|   /|   /| -8000h +2.5V     _    _    _    _    _

The effect applies only if a game does use MIN/MAX levels (ie. there'd be no
problem at Master Volume of 40h or less; unless additional output comes from
Echo Unit).

10V DC 850mA (NTSC version)
Same as above, but using a DC supply (not AC), passed through a diode (so
internally the voltage may drop from 10V to around 9V.

Power Switch / Anti-Eject
In older SNES consoles the Power switch comes with an anti-eject lever, which
goes into a notch in the cartridge. Some carts have notches with square edges;
cart cannot be removed while power is on. Other carts have notches with
diagonal edge; the lever gets pushed (while sliding along the diagonal edge),
and power is switched off automatically when removing the cartridge.
The anti-eject type is probably (?) used by carts with battery-backed SRAM, in
order to prevent garbage writes (which might occur when simultaneously ejecting
and powering-down).

SNES Expansion Port (EXT) Pinouts
---------------------------------

EXT (at bottom of console) (used by Satellaview and Exertainment)
Most pins are exactly the same as on the cartridge slot, the only special pins,
which aren't found on Cart slot, are EXT pins 21, 22, and 25: SMPCK is 8.192MHz
(24.576MHz/3) from APU, DOTCK is the PPU dot clock (around 5.3MHz, with some
stuttering during hblank period), MONO is a mono audio output.

  MONO-AUDIO  25    26  /IRQ
  L-AUDIO     27    28  R-AUDIO
The L/R-AUDIO inputs are essentially same as on cart slot, although they are
passed through separate capacitors, so there is no 0 Ohm connection between EXT
and Cart audio pins. EXT Pin 24 connects to Cart pin 2 (aside from a 10K
pull-up it isn't connected anywhere inside of the console) so this pin is
reserved for communication between cartridge hardware and ext hardware (used by
Satellaview).

Note: The WRAM is Dynamic RAM (DRAM) and does require REFRESH pulses. If
REFRESH is disabled (via DRAMMODE pin) then WRAM forgets its content after some
minutes. Whereas, refresh occurs also on /RD (with the refresh row output on
A0..A8), so, for example, games that are DMA'ing 512 bytes from WRAM to OAM in
every frame should work perfectly without REFRESH.
Interestingly, WRAM is kept intact even if the RESET button is held down for
about 30 minutes (although the CPU doesn't generate any /RD, REFRESH, nor
A0..A8 cycles during that time).

MAD-2 Pinouts (Memory Address Decoder 2)
Unknown. Used in some newer DSPn cartridges (probably similar to MAD-1, but
maybe with some pins replaced by a clock amplifier for the DSPn oscillator...
and/or maybe it supplies an inverted RESET signal to the DSPn chip).

Other Battery Controllers
Battery Controllers are used to write-protect the SRAM during
power-up/power-down, and to switch from Vbat to VCC supply when available.
Early carts used a transistor/diode circuit, later carts are using MAD-1 (or
MAD-2) or MM1026 (or MM1134) chips.

MM1026/MM1134 Pinouts
  1 GND
  2 /RESET (output)
  3 CS (to SRAM) (usually NC when using /CS)
  4 Vbat (from battery)
  5 /CS (to SRAM)
  6 Vout (to SRAM)
  7 NC (MM1026) or /Y (MM1134)
  8 VCC (from snes)
On MM1026, /CS is simply inverse of CS (both true when VCC=good). On MM1134,
the additional /Y input allows to force /CS false (but doesn't affect CS).

Batteries
  CR2032 (3 volt lithium cells, 20mm diameter, 3.2mm width) <-- most SNES carts
  CR2430 (3 volt lithium cells, 24.5mm diameter, 3mm width) <-- X-Band Modem
  NiCd (3.6V, rechargeable, but acid-leaking) <-- many Copiers

If the MUTE bit is set in FLG.6, then DATA is always 0, and additionally
/MUTE=LOW is output to the Amplifier (so the DSP is "double-muted", and, the
/MUTE signal also mutes external sound inputs like from SGB).

The Pre-amplifiers do amplify the signal from the D/A converter. The
pre-amplified signal is then mixed (via resisters and capacitors) with the
other two audio sources (from cartridge and expansion port), the result is then
passed through the Post-amplifier stage, eventually muted via transistors (if
DSP outputs /MUTE=Low), and amplified through further transistors. The final
stereo signal is output to A/V connector, and mono signals are mixed (via
resistors) for Expansion Port and TV Modulator). The LM324 chip and the
transistors are using the VS supply, rather than normal 5V VCC.

SNES Common Mods
----------------

CIC Disable
The console contains a F411 (NTSC) or F413 (PAL) chip that verifies if the
cartridge contains an identical chip, if it doesn't, then it resets the SNES,
preventing to use unlicensed carts, or to use NTSC carts on PAL consoles.
  F411/F413 Pin 4 (GND=Disable/Unlock, VCC=Enable/Lock)
Even when disabled, some newer games (eg. Donkey Kong Country) may verify the
PAL/NTSC framerate by software and refuse to run if it doesn't match the
expected setting, this can be solved by adding a framerate switch (see below),
the verification is often done only after power-up, so one can restore the
desired setting after power-up.
Some newer games are reportedly also refusing to run if the CIC chip in the
console is disabled, as a workaround, one would usually add a switch that
allows to re-enables the CIC when needed. Eventually one could also modify the
cartridges (they are probably connecting the CIC /RESET output to ROM CE2 pin
or so?).
Games with SA-1 or S-DD1 chips won't work.

50Hz/60Hz Switch
  PPU1 Pin 24 (GND=60Hz, VCC=50Hz)
  PPU2 Pin 30 (GND=60Hz, VCC=50Hz)

50Hz/60Hz Switch on newer cost-down SNES (those with 160pin S-CPUN A)
Basically, the frame rate is selected by a single pin:
  S-CPUN A, Pin 111 - PAL/NTSC  (high=PAL, low=NTSC)
An unwanted side effect is that this pin also changes the expected clock input:
  X1 oscillator (21.47727MHz=NTSC, 17.7344750MHz=PAL)
as a workaround, buy the missing oscillator, and use a "stereo" switch that
simultaneously toggles the oscillator and the PAL/NTSC pin.
Another unwanted side effect is that it does (probably) change the color clock
output for the S-RGB A chip, making the composite video signal unusable. As a
workaround, one could use a TV set with RGB input (this would also require to
connect the R,G,B,SYNC pins, which are left unconnected on the Multi-Out port
of the cost-down SNES). Eventually it might be also possible to use composite
video by connecting a matching oscillator directly to the S-RGB A chip
(NTSC:3.579545MHz, PAL:4.43361875MHz) (not tested).

Functional Description (WRAM Boot)
RESET/INIT and RDY/SELECT are used to reset and stop the CPU, in that state,
PA0-PA7 and /WRAMSEL are all LOW (of which, PA7 and /WRAMSEL need to be changed
for DMA), and WRAM address is reset to zero. Data is then DMA transferred to
WRAM via databus and /STB/PAWR. Finally, WRAM is mirrored (in HiROM fashion) to
the ROM-region via /AUTOLF, and entrypoint and program code are fetched from
WRAM.
WRAM-Boot compatible files are identified by ID "XBOO" at FFE0h in ROM Header.
WRAM-boot files should be also bootable from normal ROM (unless written by
less-than-lame people).
The WRAM upload function is found in no$sns "Utility" menu. WRAM boot works
only if a regular cartride is inserted, or if the lockout chip is disabled.
Normal ROM-cartridges can be used if the cable is disconnected, or if the
parallel port is set to /STB=HIGH, /AUTOLF=HIGH, /SELECT=HIGH, /INIT=LOW, and
DATA=HIGH-Z.

Functional Description (Extended Circuit)
Data is uploaded (in 127.5K blocks) to WRAM, and is then automatically
relocated (by a 0.5K stub) from WRAM to SRAM by software, /ACK is used to
indicate completion of relocation, after uploading all block(s) the console
gets reset with SRAM mapped to the ROM-region.
The XOR gate maps the bottom halves of the HiROM banks as additional LoROM
banks. About A(hi) and A(hi+1): For example, for 128Kx8 chip (A0..A16): connect
A(hi) to A16, A(hi+1) to A17. For more than 2Mx8 SRAM: connect the A(hi+1)
input to GND; or leave out the XOR gate completely.
/STB and /AUTOLF are used (while /SELECT=HIGH) to select ROM, WRAM, or SRAM
mapping, and as /PARD and /PAWR (while /SELECT=LOW). The /PARD pin allows to
download status information and other data from WRAM.

Requires a bi-directional parallel port (very old printer ports aren't
bi-directional, also some hyper-modern ports aren't bi-directional when
configured to "ECP" mode, for that ports: use "EPP" mode).
Currently SRAMs of up to 512Kx8 (32pin) should be available for less than $5,
also 2Mx8 chips (36pin) are manufactured, but I've no idea where to buy them,
best use a 40pin DIP socket for future expansion.

CPU Registers and Flags
-----------------------

The 65XX CPUs are equipped with not more than three general purpose registers
(A, X, Y). However, the limited number of registers is parts of covered by
comfortable memory operations, especially page 0 of memory (address
0000h-00FFh) may be used for relative fast and complicated operations, in so
far one might say that the CPU has about 256 8bit 'registers' (or 128 16bit
'registers') in memory. For details see Memory Addressing chapter.

Registers
  Bits  Name  Expl.
  8/16  A     Accumulator
  8/16  X     Index Register X
  8/16  Y     Index Register Y
  16    PC    Program Counter
  8/16  S     Stack Pointer (see below)
  8     P     Processor Status Register (see below)
  16    D     Zeropage Offset      ;expands 8bit  [nn]   to 16bit [00:nn+D]
  8     DB    Data Bank            ;expands 16bit [nnnn] to 24bit [DB:nnnn]
  8     PB    Program Counter Bank ;expands 16bit PC     to 24bit PB:PC

Stack Pointer
The stack pointer is addressing 256 bytes in page 1 of memory, ie. values
00h-FFh will address memory at 0100h-01FFh. As for most other CPUs, the stack
pointer is decrementing when storing data. However, in the 65XX world, it
points to the first FREE byte on stack, so, when initializing stack to top set
S=(1)FFh (rather than S=(2)00h).

Processor Status Register (Flags)
  Bit  Name  Expl.
  0    C     Carry         (0=No Carry, 1=Carry)
  1    Z     Zero          (0=Nonzero, 1=Zero)
  2    I     IRQ Disable   (0=IRQ Enable, 1=IRQ Disable)
  3    D     Decimal Mode  (0=Normal, 1=BCD Mode for ADC/SBC opcodes)
  4    X/B   Break Flag    (0=IRQ/NMI, 1=BRK/PHP opcode)  (0=16bit, 1=8bit)
  5    M/U   Unused        (Always 1)                     (0=16bit, 1=8bit)
  6    V     Overflow      (0=No Overflow, 1=Overflow)
  7    N     Negative/Sign (0=Positive, 1=Negative)
  -    E                                                  (0=16bit, 1=8bit)

Emulation Flag (E) (can accessed only via XCE opcode)
Activates 6502 emulation mode. In that mode, A/X/Y are 8bit (as when X/M are
set). S is 8bit (range 0100h..01FFh). The X/M flags are replaced by B/U flags
(B=Break/see below, U=Unused/always 1). Exception Vectors are changed to 6502
addresses, and exceptions push only 16bit return addresses (rather than 24bit).
Conditional Branches take one extra cycle when crossing pages.
The new 65C02 and 65C816 opcodes can be kept used; respectively, none of the
undocumented opcodes of the original 6502 CPU are supported.

Accumulator/Memory Flag (M)
Switches A to 8bit mode (the upper 8bit of A can be still accessed via XBA).
Additionally switches all opcodes that do not use A,X,Y operands (eg. STZ, and
read-modify-write opcodes like inc/dec, Rotate/Shift) to 8bit mode.

Index Register Flag (X)
Switches X and Y to 8bit mode (the upper 8bit are forcefully set to 00h).

Carry Flag (C)
Caution: When used for subtractions (SBC and CMP), the carry flag is having
opposite meaning as for normal 80x86 and Z80 CPUs, ie. it is SET when
above-or-equal. For all other instructions (ADC, ASL, LSR, ROL, ROR) it works
as normal, whereas ROL/ROR are rotating <through> carry (ie. much like 80x86
RCL/RCR and not like ROL/ROR).

Zero Flag (Z), Negative/Sign Flag (N), Overflow Flag (V)
Works just as everywhere, Z it is set when result (or destination register, in
case of some 'move' instructions) is zero, N is set when signed (ie. same as
Bit 7 of result/destination). V is set when an addition/subtraction exceeded
the maximum range for signed numbers (-128..+127).

IRQ Disable Flag (I)
Disables IRQs when set. NMIs (non maskable interrupts) and BRK instructions
cannot be disabled.

Decimal Mode Flag (D)
Packed BCD mode (range 00h..99h) for ADC and SBC opcodes.

Break Flag (B)
The Break flag is intended to separate between IRQ and BRK which are both using
the same vector, [FFFEh]. The flag cannot be accessed directly, but there are 4
situations which are writing the P register to stack, which are then allowing
the examine the B-bit in the pushed value: The BRK and PHP opcodes always write
"1" into the bit, IRQ/NMI execution always write "0".

CPU Memory Addressing
---------------------

Opcode Addressing Modes
  Name           Native   Nocash
  Implied        -        A,X,Y,S,P
  Immediate      #nn      nn
  Zero Page      nn       [nn]
  Zero Page,X    nn,X     [nn+X]

  Absolute       nnnn     [nnnn]
  Absolute,X     nnnn,X   [nnnn+X]
  Absolute,Y     nnnn,Y   [nnnn+Y]
  (Indirect,X)   (nn,X)   [[nn+X]]
  (Indirect),Y   (nn),Y   [[nn]+Y]

Zero Page - [nn] [nn+X] [nn+Y]
Uses an 8bit parameter (one byte) to address the first 256 of memory at
0000h..00FFh. This limited range is used even for "nn+X" and "nn+Y", ie.
"C0h+60h" will access 0020h (not 0120h).

Absolute - [nnnn] [nnnn+X] [nnnn+Y]
Uses a 16bit parameter (two bytes) to address the whole 64K of memory at
0000h..FFFFh. Because of the additional parameter bytes, this is a bit slower
than Zero Page accesses.

Indirect - [[nn+X]] [[nn]+Y]
Uses an 8bit parameter that points to a 16bit parameter in page zero.
Even though the CPU doesn't support 16bit registers (except for the program
counter), this (double-)indirect addressing mode allows to use variable 16bit
pointers.

On-Chip Bi-directional I/O port
Addresses (00)00h and (00)01h are occupied by an I/O port which is built-in
into 6510, 8500, 7501, 8501 CPUs (eg. used in C64 and C16), be sure not to use
the addresses as normal memory. For description read chapter about I/O ports.

Caution
Because of the identical format, assemblers will be more or less unable to
separate between [XXh+r] and [00XXh+r], the assembler will most likely produce
[XXh+r] when address is already known to be located in page 0, and [00XXh+r] in
case of forward references.
Beside for different opcode size/time, [XXh+r] will always access page 0 memory
(even when XXh+r>FFh), while [00XXh+r] may direct to memory in page 0 or 1, to
avoid unpredictable results be sure not to use (00)XXh+r>FFh if possible.

  54 dd ss  ------  7x  MVN ss,dd   LDIR [dd:Y],[ss:X],A+1  ;INC X/Y
Sets DB=dstbank (!), copies one byte from [srcbank:X] to [dstbank:Y],
increments or decrements X and Y (8bit or 16bit, depending on X and E flags),
decrements A (all 16bits, no matter of M and E flags), continues at next opcode
when resulting A=FFFFh, otherwise sets PC=PC-3 (thus repeats the transfer
opcode).
Note: The native opcode names (MVP/MVN, Move Positive/Negative) are chosen so
that "positive" refers to transfers from "to higher" memory addresses (which
would matter on overlapping source/dest blocks), accordingly, the practical
meaning is that "positive" means to DECREASE the X,Y registers.

Note: RTI cannot modify the B-Flag or the unused flag.
Glitch: For JMP [nnnn] the operand word cannot cross page boundaries, ie. JMP
[03FFh] would fetch the MSB from [0300h] instead of [0400h]. Very simple
workaround would be to place a ALIGN 2 before the data word.

or 4 cycles if it crosses a page boundary (see below for exact info).
Note: After subtractions (SBC or CMP) carry=set indicates above-or-equal,
unlike as for 80x86 and Z80 CPUs.

  --   /RESET Reset      D=0 E=1 I=1 D=0000, DB=00  PB=00, PC=[00FFFC] N/A
Notes: IRQs can be disabled by setting the I-flag, a BRK command, a NMI, and a
/RESET signal cannot be masked by setting I.
Exceptions do first change the B-flag (in 6502 mode), then write P to stack,
and then set the I-flag, the D-flag IS cleared (unlike as on original 6502).
In 6502 mode, the same vector is shared for BRK and IRQ, software can separate
between BRK and IRQ by examining the pushed B-flag only.
The RTI opcode can be used to return from BRK/IRQ/NMI, note that using the
return address from BRK skips one dummy/parameter byte following after the BRK
opcode.
Software or hardware must take care to acknowledge or reset /IRQ or /NMI
signals after processing it.
  IRQs are executed whenever "/IRQ=LOW AND I=0".
  NMIs are executed whenever "/NMI changes from HIGH to LOW".
If /IRQ is kept LOW then same (old) interrupt is executed again as soon as
setting I=0. If /NMI is kept LOW then no further NMIs can be executed.

Special Opcodes
  Opcode    Flags Clks  Native      Nocash
  DB        ------  -   STP         KILL      ;STOP/KILL
  EB        nz----  3   XBA         SWAP A    ;A=B, B=A, NZ=LSB

  EA        ------  2   NOP         NOP       ;No operation
WAI/HALT stops the CPU until an exception (usually an IRQ or NMI) request
occurs; in case of IRQs this works even if IRQs are disabled (via I=1).

Conditional Branch Page Crossing
The branch opcode with parameter takes up two bytes, causing the PC to get
incremented twice (PC=PC+2), without any extra boundary cycle. The signed
parameter is then added to the PC (PC+disp), the extra clock cycle occurs if
the addition crosses a page boundary (next or previous 100h-page).

CPU Assembler Directives/Syntax
-------------------------------

Below are some common 65XX assembler directives, and the corresponding
expressions in 80XX-style language.

  65XX-style    80XX-style         Expl.
  .native       .nocash            select native or nocash syntax
  *=$c100       org 0c100h         sets the assumed origin in memory
  *=*+8         org $+8            increments origin, does NOT produce data
  label         label:             sets a label equal to the current address
  label=$dc00   label equ 0dc00h   assigns a value or address to label
  .by $00       db 00h             defines a (list of) byte(s) in memory
  .byt $00      defb 00h           same as .by and db
  .wd $0000     dw 0000h           defines a (list of) word(s) in memory
  .end          end                indicates end of source code file
  |nn           [|nn]              force 16bit "00NN" instead 8bit "NN"
  #<nnnn        nnnn AND 0FFh      isolate lower 8bits of 16bit value
  #>nnnn        nnnn DIV 100h      isolate upper 8bits of 16bit value

Special Directives
  .65xx       Select 6502 Instruction Set
  .nes        Create NES ROM-Image with .NES extension
  .c64_prg    Create C64 file with .PRG extension/stub/fixed entry
  .c64_p00    Create C64 file with .P00 extension/stub/fixed entry/header
  .vic20_prg  Create VIC20/C64 file with .PRG extension/stub/relocated entry
  end entry   End of Source, the parameter specifies the entrypoint
The C64 files contain Basic Stub "10 SYS<entry>" with default ORG 80Eh.

VIC20 Stub
The VIC20 Stub is "10 SYSPEEK(44)*256+<entry>" with default ORG 1218h, this
relocates the entryoint relative to the LOAD address (for C64: 818h, for VIC20:
1018h (Unexpanded), 0418h (3K Expanded), 1218h (8K and more Expansion). It does
NOT relocate absolute addresses in the program, if the program wishes to run at
a specific memory location, then it must de-relocate itself from the LOAD
address to the desired address.

CPU Glitches
------------

Dummy Write Cycles in Read-Modify-Opcodes
The original 6502 CPU includes a dummy-write cycle in all Read-Modify opcodes
(ie. INC, DEC, Shift/Rotate). The 65C816 does NOT reproduce this effect
(neither when E=0, nor when E=1).

Dummy Read Cycles at Page-Wraps
  [Below applies to original 6502 CPUs]
  [Unknown if 65C816 has similar effects on page- and/or bank-wraps?]
Dummy reads occur when reads from [nnnn+X] or [nnnn+Y] or [WORD[nn]+Y] are
crossing page boundaries, this applies only to raw read-opcodes, not for write
or read-and-modify opcodes (ie. only for opcodes that include an extra clock
cycle on page boundaries, such as LDA, CMP, etc.)
For above reads, the CPU adds the index register to the lower 8bits of the
16bit memory address, and does then read from the resulting memory address, if
the addition caused a carry-out, then an extra clock cycle is used to increment
the upper 8bits of the address, and to read from the correct memory location.
For example, a read from [1280h+X] with X=C0h produces a dummy read from
[1240h], followed by the actual read from [1340h].
Dummy reads cause no problems with normal ROM or RAM, but may cause problems
with read-sensitive I/O ports (eg. IRQ flags that are automatically cleared
after reading, or data-registers that are automatically incrementing associated
memory pointers, etc.)

CPU The 65XX Family
-------------------

Different versions of the 6502:

All of these processors are the same concerning the software-side:
 6501   Some sort of 6502 prototype
 6502   Used in the CBM floppies and some other 8 bit computers.
 6507   Used in Atari 2600, 28pins (only 13 address lines, no /IRQ, no /NMI).
 6510   Used in C64, with built-in 6bit I/O port.
 7501   Used in C16,C116,Plus/4, with built-in 7bit I/O Port, without /NMI pin.
 8500   Used in C64-II, with different pin-outs.
 8501   Same as 7501
 8502   Used in C128s.

Some processors of the family which are not 100% compatible:
 65C02  Extension of the 6502
 65SC02 Small version of the 65C02 which lost a few opcodes again.
 65CE02 Extension of the 65C02, used in the C65.
 65C816 Extended 65C02 with new opcodes and 16 bit operation modes.
 2A03   Nintendo NES/Famicom, modified 6502 with built-in sound controller.

About
This document is part of the no$sns emulator/debugger help text. Copyright 2012
by Martin Korth (nocash).
PPU and APU specs are widely based on Anomie's great specs (on that part I've
mainly rearranged and reformatted the Anomie's txt files, verified most of it
on real hardware, and discovered only a few additional details).
For information on Add-Ons like Controllers or Cartridges with Coprocessors:
There haven't been any all-in-one specs (not even a complete list of existing
add-ons), so I needed to collect scattered fragments of information from
hundreds of webpages (and do a lot of puzzling and reverse-engineering on my
own).
The result should be a fairly complete document that covers almost everything
about the SNES hardware. There are still thousands of missing details (marked
by words like unknown, whatever, might, maybe, probably, or by question marks).
Info on such details (or donated hardware for research purposes) would be very
welcome!
