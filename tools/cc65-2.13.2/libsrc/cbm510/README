Implementation notes:

CONDES routines with a type code of 2 are used to implement interrupt
handlers. Note that these are called as soon as the program is started,
so they have to cope with this. The indirect segment is set to the 
system bank when calling interrupt routines, this must must not be changed
when returning.
