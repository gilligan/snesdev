Many special thanks go to the guy who started it all:

		   	John R. Dunning

Without his great work, there would not be a single freeware C crosscompiler
for the 6502 out there. He built the grounds for this cc65 and some other cc65
implementations and a lot of his code is still in the current compiler.



More special thanks to:

  * Keith W. Gerdes <kwg@netzero.net>

    Without his outstanding help, the assembler/compiler wouldn't be, what it
    is now. He helped with suggestions, bug reports and even kicked me here
    and then, when I started to get too lazy:-)

  * Kevin Ruland <kevin@rodin.wustl.edu>

    Kevin did the Apple 2 port and found at least one serious error in the
    C library while doing so.

  * Christian Groessler <cpg@aladdin.de>
    Mark Keates <Mark.Keates@dendrite.com>
    Freddy Offenga <taf_offenga@yahoo.com>
    David Lloyd <dmlloyd@atari-central.com>

    The team that added support for the Atari 8 bit machines.
    Christian Groessler also sent me several fixes for 64 bit machines.

  * Sidney Cadot <sidney@ch.twi.tudelft.nl>

    Sidney rewrote the random number generator.

  * Maciej Witkowiak <ytm@friko.onet.pl>

    Maciej wrote the GEOS support libraries for cc65.

  * Eric Au <eric_au@hotmail.com>

    Eric is one of the most active testers, and supplied me with dozens of
    bug reports.

  * MicroSystems Development Technologies Inc. located in San Jose,
    California payed me for the addition of several assembler features,
    which went also into the freeware version. These guys are selling
    nice hardware devices like EPROM emulators. If you are developing
    hardware or embedded microcontroller applications, you should have
    a look at their web site at www.msd.com.

  * Mirco Miranda <mircomir@libero.it>

    Miroc contributed Makefile additions, docs and patches to compile cc65
    cleanly under OS/2 using the EMX toolkit.

  * Marc 'BlackJack' Rintsch <blackjack@civitas64.de>

    Marc wrote and contributed BASIC compatible file I/O routines for the
    Commodore machines.

  * Groepaz <groepaz@gmx.net>

    Thanks for several nice samples programs, the NES port, and a lot of other
    code.

  * Craig Bruce

    ...for his public domain Swiftlink/Turbo232 drivers which are part
    of the cc65 library in modified form.

  * Steve Schmidtke <steve_schmidtke@hotmail.com>

    Steve contributed the VIC20 port.

  * Michael Klein <michael.klein@puffin.lb.shuttle.de>

    for the Debian support files.

  * Greg King <gngking@erols.com>

    reported quite some bugs and helped with lots of code and suggestions.

  * MagerValp <magervalp@cling.gu.se>

    for sample code regarding the Plus/4 banking, the base for the new C128
    conio library supporting 80 column mode and much more.

  * Piotr Fusik <P.Fusik@elka.pw.edu.pl>

    for the zlib routines, lots of bug reports, code snippets and
    suggestions.

  * Josef Soucek <josef.soucek@ct.cz>

    Josef contributed the CBM directory routines.

  * Stephen L. Judd

    for his GRLIB code which is the base of the C64 320x200 TGI driver.

  * Stefan A. Haubenthal <polluks@web.de>

    Stefan contributed several code snippets for the C64 and Apple ][.

  * Peter Trauner <peter.trauner@utanet.at>

    Peter added minimal Supervision support.

  * The Lynx guys: Bastian Schick, who contributed the code from his own,
    lynx-only version of cc65, and Karri Kaksonen <karri@sipo.fi> and Shawn
    Jefferson <jefferson_shawn_a8bit@yahoo.com> who built on this foundation.

  * Oliver Schmidt <ol.sc@web.de> ...

    ... for quite some Apple ][ contributions.
